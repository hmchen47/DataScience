## Overview

+ Statistics
  + objective: make references about a population based on information contained a sample
  + parameters: numerical measurements used to characterize population
  + population parameters
    + $\mu$: mean
    + $M$: median
    + $\sigma$: standard deviation
    + $\pi$: proportion

+ Inferential problems
  + formulated as an inference about one of parameters of population
  + categories of inferences
    + __estimate__ the value of the population parameters
    + __test a hypothesis__ about the value of the parameter

+ Summary of the various hypothesis tests and when to use

## One sample t-test

+ One sample t-test
  + determining whether the sample mean is statistically different from a known or hypothesized population mean
  + hypotheses: two-tailed one sample t-test
    + __Null Hypothesis:__ the sample mean = the population mean
    + __Alternative Hypothesis:__ the sample mean $\ne$ the population mean
