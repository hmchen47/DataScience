## Introduction

+ Regression analysis
  + the first step in prediction modeling
  + with R, regression analysis returns 4 plots using `plot(model_name)`
    + providing significant information or rather an interesting story about the data
    + easily failing to decipher the information or not care about what these plots say

+ Regression
  + a parametric approach
  + parametric: making assumptions about data for the purpose of analysis
  + successful regression analysis: validate assumptions
