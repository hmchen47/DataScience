## Introduction

+ Handling features
  + issue: hundreds and thousands of features w/o description
  + procedure to resolve
    + constructing a ranking w/ a __feature utility metric__, a function measuring associatiions btw a feature and a target
    + choosing a smaller set of the most useful features to develop initially and having more confidence to spend time on them

+ Mutual information
  + metric used to measure associations btw a feature and a target
  + a lot like correlation to measure a relationship btw two quantities
  + MI detecting any kind of relationship while correlation only detecting linear relationship
  + a great general-purpose metric and specially useful at the start of feature development
  + advantages
    + easy to use and interpret
    + computationally efficient
    + theoretically well-founded
    + resistant to overfitting
    + able to detect any kind of relationship
