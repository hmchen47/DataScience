## The Goal of Feature Engineering

+ Feature engineering
  + simply making data better suited to the problem at hand
  + example: apparent temperature
    + perceived temperature: temperature to human based on air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, things able to measure directly
    + apparent temperature:
      + temperature measured like the heat index, and the wind chill
      + the result of a kind of feature engineering
    + making the observed data more relevant what actually care about, how it actually feels outside

+ Reasons for feature engineering
  + improving a model's predictive performance
  + reducing computational or data needs
  + improving interpretability of the results
