1. About
================

Along with my writeup "Everything You Wanted to Know About the Kernel
Trick (But Were Too Afraid to Ask)", I am releasing the Python scripts
I used to generate the figures/empirical results.

================
2. Prerequisites
================

Along with Python (I'm using Python 2.7, 32-bit), you'll need the following
libraries:

    1. numpy, scipy
           Very popular library for general-purpose numerical 
           computation.
               http://www.numpy.org/
               http://www.scipy.org/
    2. sklearn
            A Python library to allow easy machine learning 
            development.
                http://scikit-learn.org/
    3. matplotlib
            A Python library to allow easy plotting/figure generation
            facilities.
                http://matplotlib.org/

================
3. Usage
================

First, generate the linearly nonseparable data by running:

    $ python generate_dataset.py -save mydataset.p
    
This will save the (randomly) generated dataset to a pickle'd file
'mydataset.p'.

Next, run the SVM demo by running:

    $ python kernel_trick.py mydataset.p
