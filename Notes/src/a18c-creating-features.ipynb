In Pandas, you can apply arithmetic operations to columns just as if they were ordinary numbers.\n\nIn the *Automobile* dataset are features describing a car's engine. Research yields a variety of formulas for creating potentially useful new features. The \"stroke ratio\", for instance, is a measure of how efficient an engine is versus how performant:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"autos[\"stroke_ratio\"] = autos.stroke / autos.bore\n\nautos[[\"stroke\", \"bore\", \"stroke_ratio\"]].head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"The more complicated a combination is, the more difficult it will be for a model to learn, like this formula for an engine's \"displacement\", a measure of its power:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"autos[\"displacement\"] = (\n    np.pi * ((0.5 * autos.bore) ** 2) * autos.stroke * autos.num_of_cylinders\n)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Data visualization can suggest transformations, often a \"reshaping\" of a feature through powers or logarithms.

You can aggregate such features by creating a **count**.\n\nThese features will be *binary* (`1` for Present, `0` for Absent) or *boolean* (`True` or `False`). In Python, booleans can be added up just as if they were integers.\n\nIn *Traffic Accidents* are several features indicating whether some roadway object was near the accident. This will create a count of the total number of roadway features nearby using the `sum` method:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"roadway_features = [\"Amenity\", \"Bump\", \"Crossing\", \"GiveWay\",\n    \"Junction\", \"NoExit\", \"Railway\", \"Roundabout\", \"Station\", \"Stop\",\n    \"TrafficCalming\", \"TrafficSignal\"]\naccidents[\"RoadwayFeatures\"] = accidents[roadway_features].sum(axis=1)\n\naccidents[roadway_features + [\"RoadwayFeatures\"]].head(10)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"You could also use a dataframe's built-in methods to *create* boolean values.

US phone numbers, for instance, have an area code (the `'(999)'` part) that tells you the location of the caller. As always, some research can pay off here.\n\nThe `str` accessor lets you apply string methods like `split` directly to columns.

With a group transform you can create features like: \"the average income of a person's state of residence,\" or \"the proportion of movies released on a weekday, by genre.\" If you had discovered a category interaction, a group transform over that categry could be something good to investigate.\n\nUsing an aggregation function, a group transform combines two features: a categorical feature that provides the grouping and another feature whose values you wish to aggregate.

Here are some guidelines:\n<ul>\n<li> Linear models learn sums and differences naturally, but can't learn anything more complex.\n<li> Ratios seem to be difficult for most models to learn. Ratio combinations often lead to some easy performance gains.\n<li> Linear models and neural nets generally do better with normalized features. Neural nets especially need features scaled to values not too far from 0. Tree-based models (like random forests and XGBoost) can sometimes benefit from normalization, but usually much less so.\n<li> Tree models can learn to approximate almost any combination of features, but when a combination is especially important they can still benefit from having it explicitly created, especially when data is limited.\n<li> Counts are especially helpful for tree models, since these models don't have a natural way of aggregating information across many features at once.\n</ul>\n</blockquote>"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Your Turn #\n\n[**Combine and transform features**](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/14393912) from *Ames* and improve your model's performance."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
