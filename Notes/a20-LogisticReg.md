## Introduction

+ Logistic regression
  + a classification algorithm used to assign observations to a discrete set of classes
  + transforming output using the sigmoid function to return a probability value
  + mapping probability value to two pr more discrete classes
  + linear regression: outputs w/ continuous number values

+ Linear regression vs logistic regression
  + linear regression
    + predictions w/ continuous value (numbers in a range)
    + example: predicting the student's test score on a scale of 0 - 100
  + logistic regression
    + predictions w/ discrete value (only specific values or categories allowed)
    + viewing probability score underlying the model's classifications
    + example: predicting the student passed or failed




## Binary logistic Regression
