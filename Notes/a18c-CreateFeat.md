## Introduction

+ Tips to discovering new features
  + understand the features: referring to data documentation if available
  + acquire domain knowledge: research the problem domain
  + study previous work
  + use data visualization:
    + revealing pathologies in the distribution of a feature
    + simplifying complicated relationships
    + a must step for feature engineering process
