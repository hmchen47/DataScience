## 1. An Introduction

+ Feature selection
  + a.k.a. variable selection, attribute selection or subset selection
  + the process by which a data scienist selects automatically and manually a subset of relevant features to use in ML model building
  + selecting the best subset of attributes
    + most important
    + high contribution at the time of prediction making
  + a critical process in any ML pipeline
  + designed to remove irrelevant, redundant, and noisy features
  + preserving a small subset of features from the primary feature space
  + impact: model's performance
  + advantages
    + reducing computational complexity
    + improving model accuracy
    + increasing model interpretability
