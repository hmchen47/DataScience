  + a partitioning of the variation in the data
  + a great tool to help to discover important relationship in the data
  + used to create more informative features
  + typically applied to [standardized](https://bit.ly/2S9yMM2) data
  + variation meaning
    + standardized data: correlation
    + unstandardized data: covariance
