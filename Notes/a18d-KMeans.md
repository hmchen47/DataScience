## Introduction

+ Unsupervised learning algorithms
  + not making use of a target
  + purpose:
    + learning some property of the data
    + representing the structure of the features in a certain way
  + a "feature discovery" technique in terms of feature engineering

+ Clustering
  + the assigning of data points to groups
  + group based on how similar the points to each other
  + making "birds of a feather flock together"
  + used for feature engineering: an attempt to discover
    + groups of customers representing a market segment
    + geographic areas sharing similar weather patterns
  + adding a feather of cluster labels $\to$ untangle complicated relationships of space and proximity


## Cluster Labels as a Feature





## k-Means Clustering





## Example - California Housing





## Exercise
