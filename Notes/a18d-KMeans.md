## Introduction

+ Unsupervised learning algorithms
  + not making use of a target
  + purpose:
    + learning some property of the data
    + representing the structure of the features in a certain way
  + a "feature discovery" technique in terms of feature engineering



## Cluster Labels as a Feature





## k-Means Clustering





## Example - California Housing





## Exercise
