## Introduction

+ Evidence-based medicine (EBM)
  + levels and qualifying studies
    + I: High-quality, multicenter or single-center, randomized controlled trial with adequate power; or systematic review of these studies
    + II: Lesser quality, randomized controlled trial; prospective cohort study; or systematic review of these studies
    + III: Retrospective comparative study; case-control study; or systematic review of these studies
    + IV: Case-series
    + V: Expert opinion; case report or clinical example; or evidence based on physiology, bench research, or “first principles”
  + randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology
    + held the pre-eminent position in the hierarchy of EBM as level I evidence
    + developed for drug trials
    + difficulty for surgical investigations
  + observational studies
    + providing results similar to RCTs
    + challenging the belief
    + playing an important role in deriving evidence for plastic surgery
    + level II and III evidence in EBM
    + recent challenge: vulnerable to influenced by unpredictable confounding factors
    + complement RCTs in hypothesis generation, establishing questions for further RCTs, and defining clinical conditions

+ Analytic study designs
  + category of analytic study design (left diagram)
  + goal: to identify and evaluate causes or risk factors of diseases or health-related events
  + differences of experimental and observational design
    + experimental study: the presence or absence of undergoing an intervention defining the groups
    + observational study: simply observing and accessing the strength of the relationship btw exposure and outcome (disease variable)
  + Types of observational studies
    + case-control and cohort studies: measuring disease occurrence and its association w/ an exposure by offering a temporal dimension (i.e. prospective and retrospective study design)
    + cross-section / prevalence studies
      + examining the data on outcome and exposure at one particular time point
      + no temporal relationship btw disease occurrence and exposure
      + unable to assess the cause and effect relationship
  + Temporal design of observational studies (right diagram)
    + cross-sectional study: no inherent temporal dimension
    + cohort study: either retrospective or prospective
    + case-control study: retrospective; assessing the history of the subject for the presence or absence of an exposure
    + retrospective ('retro' = 'back, behind') studies: looking back in time to examine causal association
    + prospective ('pro') = 'before, in front of') studies: looking ahead in time to examine causal association

## Cohort Study

+ Definition of cohort
  + 'cohort' $\gets$ 'cohors' in Latin
  + Roman: a cohort = a specific number of warriors and commanding centurions $\to$ traceable
  + epidemiology: cohort = a set of people followed over a period of time
  + modern epidemiological definition: a group of people w/ defined characteristics who are followed up to determine incidence of, or mortality from, some specific disease, all causes of death, or some other outcome


### Study design of cohort studies

+ Cohort study
  + an outcome or disease-free study population
  + defined by the exposure or event of interest and followed in time until the disease of outcome of interest occurs (diagram)
  + exposure identified before outcome $\implies$ a temporal framework to assess causality and then having the potential to provide the strongest scientific evidence
  + advantages
    + gathering data regarding sequence of events; able to assess causality
    + examining multiple outcomes for a given exposure
    + good for investigating rare exposures
    + able to calculate rates of disease in exposed and unexposed individuals over time(e.g. incidence, relative risk)
  + disadvantages
    + requiring large number of subjects to study rare exposures
    + susceptible to selection bias
    + prospective cohort study
      + may be expensive to conduct
      + may be require long duration to follow up
      + may be difficult to maintain follow-up
      + susceptible to loss to follow-up or withdrawals
    + retrospective cohort study
      + susceptible to recall bias or information bias
      + less control over variables

    </a>
  </div>

+ Prospective cohort studies
  + carried out from the present into the future
  + designed w/ specific data collection methods
  + advantage: tailored to collect specific exposure data and more complete
  + disadvantage:
    + the long follow-up period while waiting for events or diseases to occur
    + inefficient for investigating diseases w/ long latency periods
    + vulnerable to a high loss to follow-up rate
  + examples: the landmark Framingham Heart study and plastic surgery

+ Retrospective cohort studies
  + a.k.a historical cohort studies
  + carried out the present time and looking to the past to examine medical events or outcomes
  + timeliness and inexpensive nature
  + choosing a cohort of subjects based on exposure status at the present time
  + reconstructing measured outcome data (i.e. disease status, event status) for analysis
  + disadvantage:
    + the limited control over collected data 
    + data: incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent btw subjects
  + advantage: inexpensive, short time period
  + example: Spear et al.
    + task: examining the effect of obesity and complication rates after undergoing the pedicled TRAM flap
    + reconstructed by retrospectively reviewing 224 pedicled TRAM flaps in 200 patients over 10-year period
    + subjects selected and categorized into cohorts by their exposure status: normal/underweight, overweight, or obesity
    + outcomes of interest: flap and donor site complications
    + findings: obese patients had a significantly higher incidence of donor site complications, multiple flap complications, and partial flap necrosis than normal or overweight patients
    + advantage: immediate access to data
    + disadvantage: the limited control over the data collection because data was gathered retrospectively over 10-years

+ Case-series
  + difference w/ cohort studies: the presence of a control, or unexposed, group
  + descriptive studies following one small group of subjects
  + extensions of case reports
  + cases obtained from the author's experiences, generally involving a small group w/o control group
  + often confused w/ cohort study when only one group of subjects presents
  + clarified unless a second comparative group serving as a control
  + to strengthen an observation from a case-series by selecting appropriate control groups to conduct a cohort or case-control studies


### Methodological issues of Cohort Studies

+ Selection of subjects
  + hallmark: defining the selected group of subjects by exposure status at the start of the investigation
  + characteristic: selecting both the exposed and unexposed groups from the same source population (diagram)
  + excluding subjects not at risk for developing the outcome
  + source population determined by practical considerations, such as sampling
  + examples of sampling subjects: hospital, member of community, or a doctor's individual practice

  </div>

+ Attrition bias (loss to follow-up)
  + long follow-up period $\implies$ minimizing loss of follow-up
  + loss to follow-up: a situation losing contact w/ the subject $\implies$ missing data
  + losing too many subjects $\implies$ the internal validity reduced
  + rule of thumb: the loss to follow-up rate $<20\%$ of the samples
  + examining any systemic differences related to the outcome and exposure of risk factors by comparing individuals
  + selecting the subjects able to be followed through the study

+ Methods to minimize loss to follow-up
  + during enrollment
    + exclude subject likely to be lost
      + planning to move
      + non-committal
    + obtain information to allow future tracking
      + collect subject's contact information (e.g. mailing addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses)
      + collect social security and/or Medicare numbers
  + during follow-up
    + maintain periodic contact
      + by telephone: many require calls during the weekends and/or evenings
      + by mail: repeated mailings by email or w/ stamped, self-addressed return envelopes
      + other: newsletters or token gifts w/ study logo


## Case-control Studies

+ History of cost-effect studies
  + born out of interest of disease etiology
    + diseased patient questioned and examined
    + knitting elements together to reveal characteristics or factors that predisposed the patient to disease
  + conceptual basis similar to taking a history and physical
  + reasons of practicality and feasibility inherent in study design $\implies$ cohort study or case-control study
  + Janet Lane-Claypon, breast cancer, 1926: low fertility rate raising the risk of breast cancer
  + study crystallized w/ the publication linking smoking ad lung cancer
  + more prominent in the biomedical literature w/ more rigorous methodological advanced in design, execution, and analysis


### Study design of cast-control studies

+ Case-control studies
  + identifying subjects by outcome at the outset of the investigation
  + outcome of interest: subject undergone a specific type of surgery, experienced a complication, or a diagnosed w/ a disease
  + case-control study design (diagram)
    + case: identifying outcome status and categorizing subjects
    + control: selecting subjects w/o the outcome but from the same source population
    + collecting data about exposure to a risk factor or several risk factors via interview, abstraction from records, or survey
  + suitable for investigating rare outcomes or outcomes w/ long letency period $\impliedby$ subjects selected from the outset by their outcome status
  + advantages:
    + good for examining rare outcomes or outcomes w/ long latency
    + relatively quick to conduct
    + relatively inexpensive
    + requiring comparatively few subjects
    + existing records used
    + examining multiple exposures or risk factors
  + disadvantages
    + susceptible to recall bias or information bias
    + difficult to validate information
    + incomplete control of extraneous variables
    + difficult to select an appropriate comparison group
    + unable to determine rates of disease in exposed and unexposed individuals

+ Example: environment and genetic factors associated w/ rare congenital microtia
  + Zhang et al,: examining the association of environment and genetic w/ rare congenital mictotia
  + Hypothesis: estimated prevalence (0.83, 17.4) in 10,000
  + case: 121 congenital microtia selected based on clinical phenotype
  + control: 152 uneffected microtia
  + population: Hans Chinese origin from Jiangsu matched by age and sex in the same hospital and same period
  + case & control w/ same genetic background $\implies$ investigating association btw genetic and congenital microtia
  + questionnaire to mothers to examine the environment factors
  + findings: adverse maternal health was among the main risk factors for congenital microtia,
    + specifically maternal disease during pregnancy, OR = 5.89, 95% CI = (2.36, 14.72)
    + maternal toxicity exposure during pregnancy, OR= 4.76, 95% CI = (1.66, 13.68)
    + resident area (air population), OR = 7.00, 95% CI = (2.09, 23.47)
  + case-control study design
    + most efficient for this investigation, given the rarity of disease outcome
    + congenital microtia w/ multifactorial causes $\implies$ the ability to examine multiple exposures and risk factors


### Methodological issues of case-control studies

+ Selection of cases
  + sampling started with
    + explicitly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria
    + e.g. a disease, specific diagnostic criteria, disease subtype, stage of disease, or degree if severity
    + criteria ensuring all cases homogeneous
  + selected from various sources
    + sources: hospital patients, clinical patients, or community subjects
    + validity issues
      + e.g. risk factors unique to single hospital
      + e.g. cases from the hospital vs the community, more severe from the hospital
    + weakening the generalizability of the study findings
  + representative of cases in the target population
    + cases from the original target population filtered out

      </a>
    </div>

+ Selection of controls
  + one of the most demanding aspects
  + important principle
    + the distribution of exposure should be the same among cases and controls
    + i.e. both cases and controls should stem from the same source population
  + same inclusion criteria: the validity depending on the comparability of these two groups
  + example: Chung et al.
    + task: maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and the risk of newborns developing cleft lip/palate
    + use of the 1996 US Natality database where cases and controls selected
    + case/outcome: newborn development of cleft lip/palate
    + hypothesis: incidence w/ 1/1000 live births
    + controls: healthy newborns
    + generalizable to the general population 
    + significant relationship: adjusted OR = 1.34, 95% CI = (1.36, 1.76)

+ Matching strategy
  + a method in an attempt to
    + ensure comparability btw cases and controls
    + reduce variability and systematic difference due to background variables not interested
  + individual matching
    + each cases typically individually paired w/ a control subject w.r.t. the background variables
    + exposure to the risk factor of interest compared btw the cases and the controls
  + confounder
    + variables associated w/ risk factor
    + potentially a cause of the outcome
    + e.g. age, sex, and race often used to match cases and controls
  + advantages
    + eliminating influence of measurable confounders
    + eliminating influence of confounders difficult to measure
    + a sampling convenience making it easier to select the controls
    + improving study efficiency
  + disadvantages
    + time-consuming and expensive
    + decision to match and confounding variables to match decided at the outset of the study
    + matched variables unable to be examined in the study
    + requiring a matching analysis
    + vulnerable to overmatching: when matching variable having some relationship w/ the outcome

+ Multiple controls
  + rare outcomes: a limited number of cases to select from w/ a large number of controls
  + providing more information if multiple control per case
  + increasing statistical power $\to$ increasing the sample size
  + improving precision by having about up to 3 or 4 controls per case

+ Bias in case-control studies
  + Achilles heel: evaluating exposure status
  + information collected by self-report, interview, or from recorded information
  + susceptible: recall bias, interview bias, or relying on the completeness or accuracy of recorded information
  + bias decreasing the validity $\implies$ carefully addressed and reduced in study design
  + recall bias:
    + occurred when differential response btw cases and controls
    + common scenario: a subject w/ disease (case) unconsciously recall and report an exposure w/ better clarity
  + interviewer bias
    + interviewer leading questions or inconsistent interview approach btw cases and controls
    + solution: implementing a standardized interview in a non-judgmental atmosphere w/ well-trained interviewers
