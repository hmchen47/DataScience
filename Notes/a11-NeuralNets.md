+ Learn and practice a concept in two ways
  + option 1
    + learn the entire theory on a particular subject
    + find ways to apply those concepts
    + goals: how an entire algorithms, maths, assumptions, limitations, and applying
  + options 2
    + start w/ simple basics and picking an intuition on the subject
    + pick a problem and solve it
    + goals: how to apply an algorithm w/ different parameters, values, limits to understand the algorithm

+ Simple intuition behind Neural networks
  + forward propagation: an estimation process
    + taking several inputs
    + processing inputs through multiple neurons from multiple hidden layers
    + returning result using an output layer
  + backward propagation
    + trying to minimize the error of actual (desired) output and forward propagation output
    + by adjusting the value/weight of neurons to minimize their contributions
  + gradient descent
    + a common algorithm to reduce the number of iterations to minimize the error
    + optimizing the task quickly and efficiently

+ Multi-Layer Perceptron and its basics
  + taking multiple inputs and produces one output
