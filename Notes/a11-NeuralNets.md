+ Learn and practice a concept in two ways
  + option 1
    + learn the entire theory on a particular subject
    + find ways to apply those concepts
    + goals: how an entire algorithms, maths, assumptions, limitations, and applying
  + options 2
    + start w/ simple basics and picking an intuition on the subject
    + pick a problem and solve it
    + goals: how to apply an algorithm w/ different parameters, values, limits to understand the algorithm
