+ Motivation
  + scenario 1: identify a flower image
    + how does a computer store an image?
    + identify the attributes of the image
    + store pixel intensities $\to$ matrix
  + scenario 2: XGBOOST
    + an algorithm employed most frequently by winners of Data Science Competition
    + store numerical data in Matrix form
    + enable to process faster and more accurate
  + scenario 3: deep learning
    + using matrix to store inputs
    + weights learned by NN also store in matrix
  + scenario 4: text processing
    + common techniques: Bag of Words, Terms Document s and frequency in matrix
    + store counts (or other similar attributes) of words in documents and frequency in matrix

+ Representation of problems in Linear Algbra
