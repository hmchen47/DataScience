# Homework 1
#
# Data set: hw1_data.csv

data <- read.csv(file="hw1_data.csv", head=TRUE, sep=",")

#
# Questions:
#
# 12. Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the 
#     console. What does the output look like?
#
# A.        Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
#       1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
#       2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
#
#   You can extract the first two rows using the [ operator and an 
#   integer sequence to index the rows.
#

initial<-read.csv(file="hw1_data.csv", head=TRUE, nrow=2)

#
# 13. How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?
#
# A. 153, You can use the `nrow()' function to compute the number of 
#    rows in a data frame.
#

nrow(data)


# 14. Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the 
#     console. What does the output look like?
#
# A.        Ozone Solar.R  Wind Temp Month Day
#     152    18     131    8.0   76     9  29
#     153    20     223   11.5   68     9  30
#   The `tail()' function is an easy way to extract the last few 
#   elements of an R object.

tail(data, n=2)

#
# 15. What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?
#
# A. 21, The single bracket [ operator can be used to extract individual 
#       rows of a data frame.

names(data)

data[47, 1]

#
# 16. How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
#
# A. 37, The `is.na' function can be used to test for missing values.
#

length(data$Ozone[data$Ozone=="NA"])

# 17. What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude 
#     missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.
#
# A. 42.1, The `mean' function can be used to calculate the mean.
#

mean(data$Ozone[], na.rm=TRUE)

#
# 18. Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values 
#     are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of 
#     Solar.R in this subset?
#
# A. 212.8, You need to construct a logical vector in R to match the 
#    question's requirements. Then use that logical vector to subset 
#    the data frame.
#

mean(data$Solar.R[data$Ozone>31 & data$Temp>90], na.rm=TRUE)

#
# 19. What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?
#
# A. 79.1
#

mean(data$Temp[data$Month==6], na.rm=TRUE)

#
# 20. What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month 
#     = 5)?
#
# A. 115
#

max(data$Ozone[data$Month==5], na.rm=TRUE)
