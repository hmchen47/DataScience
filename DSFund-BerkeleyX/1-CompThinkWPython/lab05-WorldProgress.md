# Lab 5: World Progress (Jupyter Notebook)

Please complete Lab 5 by the end of Sunday, May 13 ( 11:59PM Anywhere on Earth] ) to receive a score. Submissions will be accepted until Sunday, May 13.

You can verify that you will receive full credit by running the final cell in the lab notebook, but your score may not update in the Progress tab for a few days after you complete the lab. 

If you choose not to use Jupyter notebooks for the course for accessibility reasons, you can instead complete the Alternative Lab 5 in the next section. It's the same assignment in a different format. If you can use Jupyter notebooks, then please complete this version only, and you will be done with this week's required assignments.

# Alternative Lab 5: World Progress (Non-Notebook Workflow)

You do not need to complete this version of Lab 5 unless you find that completing the Jupyter notebook version of the lab assignment is problematic for accessibility reasons. If you can use Jupyter notebooks, then you should complete this version instead.

Please complete Lab 5 by the end of Sunday, May 13 ( 11:59PM Anywhere on Earth ) to receive a score.

If you choose not to use Jupyter to complete the lab, there is also a non-notebook workflow. Read the instructions linked below.
