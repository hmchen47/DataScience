## Lab 0: Practice with Jupyter Notebooks

### Notes

__Lab 0__ is ungraded and meant to introduce you to Jupyter notebooks.  You are strongly encouraged to complete it. It's quick, and you'll likely have fewer questions later if you complete this lab now.

(If you choose not to use Jupyter notebooks for accessibility reasons, you can skip this lab. If you aren't sure whether Jupyter notebooks will work for you, try this lab to find out.)
