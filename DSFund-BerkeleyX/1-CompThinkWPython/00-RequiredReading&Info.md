### Welcome

Welcome to Data 8.1X Foundations of Data Science: Computational Thinking with Python.  This course is the first course in a three-part series called Data 8X, a professional certificate program in data science from UC Berkeley. This first course focuses on programming and data visualization. The second course, which will start just after this course completes, will focus on statistical inference. The third course, which will start just after the second course completes, will focus on prediction and machine learning.

Data 8X is based on a rigorous first-year undergraduate course at UC Berkeley called Foundations of Data Science. Over 1,000 students take this course each semester. The course is designed as an introduction to programming and statistics for students from many different majors. It teaches practical techniques that apply across many disciplines, and also serves as the technical foundation for more advanced courses in data science, statistics, and computer science. 

No prior programming experience is necessary, but many of the programming techniques covered in this course do not appear in a typical introduction to programming. The programming content of this course focuses on manipulating data tables, rather than building software applications. Therefore, students who take the course after taking other programming courses often learn a new approach to programming that they haven't encountered before. 

No prior statistics experience is necessary, but many of the statistical inference techniques covered in this course do not appear in a undergraduate statistics curriculum. The techniques in this course rely heavily on sampling and simulation, and they require computers to carry out.  Therefore, students who have taken statistics courses before often learn new methods to complement what they already know.

Data science is more than just a combination of programming and statistics. Effective data science requires understanding problem domains and correctly interpreting domain-specific approaches. The examples in this course are largely drawn from real-world data sets, and one of the main goals of this course is to develop the ability to apply analysis and prediction techniques to real-world scenarios.

### Expectations and Requirements

#### Prerequisites

+ Good comprehension of English
+ Fluency with basic arithmetic and algebra

Although prior computer science or statistics knowledge tends to allow learners to complete assignments more quickly, __this course it is designed specifically for those who have not previously taken statistics or computer science courses.__

#### Equipment and Supplies

+ A computer,
+ A browser that supports EdX, and
+ A browser that supports Jupyter notebooks to complete lab assignments. (For full accessibility, we also offer a non-notebook workflow.) We highly recommend using Google Chrome to complete Jupyter notebook lab assignments.

#### Recommended Text

+ Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science by Ani Adhikari, and John DeNero, with contributions by David Wagner; 2018. This text was created for this course and is available for free at inferentialthinking.com]. Reading this text is not required, but many past UC Berkeley students report that it was helpful for mastering the course material.

#### Course Structure

+ The course lasts for 5 weeks, Monday April 2rd through Monday May 7th. Most students will spend 4-8 hours per week on this course.
+ Instruction is largely through voice-over video of slides (known as “video lecture segments”) in the Courseware section of the Data 8.1X website. All of the material required in Data 8.1X will be covered in these video lecture segments.
+ The online text is a supplement; it was written for UC Berkeley’s Data 8 by Prof. Ani Adhikari and Prof. John DeNero.  Learners may use any combination of materials that they find convenient.
+ Support will be provided via discussion forums. Please respect the edX Honor Code.
+ The material of the course has been divided into three or four sections per week, based on natural breaks in the material. Each week will include a required programming-based lab assignment. There are also reading and practice sections each week, but the practice problems in these sections are ungraded. Only the weekly lab assignments count toward your final score for the course.
+ There are no exams.

#### Honor Code

You are required to follow the [edX Honor Code](https://www.edx.org/honor). The course staff would like to express their appreciation of all the learners who follow the honor code scrupulously.

The honor code is not just decoration or boilerplate; it sets out community standards that make the course grades and certificate meaningful, and indeed make the entire endeavor of the course worthwhile. Publishing course materials without proper attribution is theft of intellectual property; asking others to do your work for you is cheating. Please do not diminish the honest efforts of your fellow learners by violating the honor code. Don’t steal or cheat.

#### Grading

+ Labs are due on specified dates and times. __You are responsible for converting the deadlines to your local time zone.__
+ There are five labs in total.  Each lab will be worth 20% of your final grade.
+ Certificates of completion will be awarded to those who score 75% or higher overall.

### Discussion Forum Guidelines

The discussion forum is available to discuss any topic related to the course, including technical questions. Here are some friendly guidelines to help you successfully navigate and interact on the forum:

+ On each page, there is a link at the bottom which says “show discussion.” Clicking on this link will show all the discussion on  the forum associated with this particular video or problem.
+ Be very specific about where you need help. Are you stuck on a particular part of the problem? Do you need help understanding a particular concept? What have you tried doing so far?
+ Please do not post problem solutions. If you need help, post  errors you’re encountering, but not your answers. Posts containing solutions will be deleted.
+ Use a descriptive and specific title for your post. A clear title will attract the attention of other students having the same issue.
+ Actively upvote other posts, and other students will upvote yours! The more upvotes your posts have, the more likely they are to be seen.
+ Use the search button. Many of your course classmates are likely to have the same questions as you. If you perform a search for your question first, you may find the answer without needing to post yourself.
+ Be respectful of others. Insulting or condescending comments will not be tolerated. People are taking this course to learn something new, not to demonstrate what they already know. If someone else is confused or stuck, take the initiative to help them out, and please never put them down.

## [Optional] Non-notebook Workflow <a name="nnwf"></a>

### Non-notebook Workflow Setup and Installation

You do not need to follow the instructions on this page unless you discover that completing the lab assignments is problematic for accessibility reasons. __Please continue to the Week 1 content by clicking Course above, unless you require a screen reader or some other accessibility feature that is not supported by the Jupyter notebook interface.__

__(Please read the paragraph above. Many students do not need to read the remainder of this page.)__

The non-notebook workflow allows you to complete all lab assignments without using Jupyter notebooks. This option is provided to maximize accessibility of course material, but it requires additional setup.

In order to properly use the non-notebook workflow, follow the instructions below to set up your computer to run the labs.  Carefully read and follow each instruction.  You will be installing and using Anaconda, a popular tool used for Python and data science, as well as an editor called Microsoft Visual Studio Code (also known as VSCode).

#### Step 1.

Download Anaconda using the correct link below for your specific operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux).

+ [Mac Anaconda](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg) 
+ [Windows Anaconda](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)
+ [Linux Anaconda](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh)

#### Step 2.
Once you download the Anaconda file, find the downloaded file in your file browser and open the downloaded file. Follow the default setup instructions to install Anaconda, but with one exception. Near the end of the installation process, there should be an option to install "Microsoft Visual Studio Code".  Select the "__Install Microsoft VSCode__" button. 

#### Step 3.

If you installed VSCode successfully in step 2, you can skip step 3.

If you did not install Microsoft Visual Studio Code in Step 2, download Microsoft VSCode using the correct link below for your specific operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux). Find the downloaded file in your file browser and open the downloaded file. Follow the setup instructions to install VSCode.

+ [Mac VSCode](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=620882)
+ [Windows VSCode](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=852157)
+ [Linux VSCode](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868)

#### Step 4.

Follow the instruction for your specific operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux).

Mac: open the "Terminal" application on your computer in your "Applications" folder. This is a default application that comes with all Mac computers like "Safari".

Windows: open the "Anaconda Command Prompt" application. This is installed by Anaconda.

Linux: open the "Terminal" application. This is a default application that comes with most Linux distributions.

### Step 5.

This step assumes you have opened Terminal or Command Prompt successfully.  These are command line interfaces used for controlling your system. To put simply, it's a place were you can type text that runs commands on your computer. Note that the text inside Terminal or Command Prompt grows downwards. Screen reader users should navigate to the bottom of the application before inputting any text.

Inside Terminal or Command Prompt, input the following command into the application and press "Enter".  Note for screen reader users. When installing, screen reader users might hear "bar slash" etc. over and over again.  This just means the installation is "in progress" and you can stop the screen reader at this point until installation is successful. Once the installation is completed, you should note that you are at the bottom of the content.  To confirm that the installation completed successfully, read backwards with your screen review mode.

```shell
pip install -q datascience okpy
```
Once you confirm the installation is successful, you can close the Terminal or Command Prompt application.

You have now completed setup and installation to use the non-notebook workflow.

### Downloading and Completing Labs

Each week, you will need to download the lab files for the non-notebook workflow. These instructions assume that you have correctly set up the Non-notebook Workflow instructions in the edX courseware.

Follow the instructions below to download labs each week and learn how to complete them using Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

#### Step 1.

Download the lab notebook files. 

Select the file for the week's lab and download the zip file for the lab.  Unzip the lab zip file and move it to somewhere on your local computer drive. We recommend making a new centralized folder called "data8x" to store all your Data 8X lab files.

Every week, the corresponding week's lab assignment will be available here for download.

__Lab Download Links__

+ [Download Lab 1](https://github.com/data-8/materials-x18-raw/blob/master/materials_zips/x18/lab/1/lab01.zip?raw=true)

#### Step 2.

Once you have downloaded the lab assignment, open the Microsoft "Visual Studio Code" application on your computer.  This is a text editor used for coding, and you will complete all your lab assignments in Visual Studio Code. 

You should get familiar with Visual Studio Code by reading the getting started guide and documentation located on the Microsoft [Visual Studio Code Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

Here are some more helpful links on how to use Visual Studio Code.

[Code Editor Basics Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics)

##### Screen Reader Guides and Instructions
If you are using a screen reader, we highly recommend reading the following documentation on using Visual Studio Code

+ [Using Screen Readers with Visual Studio Code Instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_screen-readers)
+ [Keyboard Shortcuts Reference Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference)
+ [Keyboard Navigation Instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_keyboard-navigation)
+ [Tab Navigation Instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_tab-navigation%22)
+ [Tab Trapping Instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_tab-trapping)
+ [Accessibility Help](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_accessibility-help)

#### Step 3.

Make sure you understand how to use and navigate Visual Studio Code by reading the documentation in step 2!

In Microsoft Visual Studio Code, open the corresponding week's lab folder (lab01, lab02, etc).  Go to File > Open and find the lab folder on your computer.  Open the lab folder inside Visual Studio Code.

Open the Explorer Side Bar by going to View > Explorer, there should be a "labxx.py" file where "xx" is the lab number (i.e. "lab01.py").  This is the raw python lab file.  You can edit and complete the lab by going through the raw python lab file.

#### Step 4.

To run the autograder tests and check your work, you need to use the Integrated Terminal.  Go to View > Integrated Terminal. This opens a new Terminal pane in your Visual Studio application.  In order to run the autograder tests, type the following code command into the terminal pane and press "Enter" to execute.  Note that the text inside the Integrated Terminal pane grows downward, so if you run the code command, you can see your autograder results by navigating back up.

```shell
python3 lab01.py
```

Also notice that the code changes for the corresponding lab (i.e. if you are working on lab 4, you should input "python3 lab04.py").

#### Step 5.

Complete the lab by reading and changing the "labxx.py" file.  Make sure to save your changes (File > Save) as you work through the lab.

#### Step 6.

Once you have completed lab and saved your changes, go back to the edX courseware and find the lab uploader in the Alternative Lab section.  Submit your labs using the lab uploader by the lab deadline date.
