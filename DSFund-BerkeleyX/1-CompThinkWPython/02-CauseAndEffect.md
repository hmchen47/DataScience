# Section 2: Cause and Effect

## Lec 2.1 Questions

### Notes

+ Observation
    + __individuals__, study subjects, participants, units
        + Eurpoean adults
    + treatment
        + chocolate consumption
    + outcome
        + heart disease
+ Association: Is there __any relation__ between chocolate consumption and heart disease?
    + association
        + any realtion
        + link
    + Answer:
        + Some data: 
            > Among those in the top of chocolate consumption, 12 percent developed or died of cardiovascular disease during the study, compared to 17.4 percent of those who didn't eat chocolate.  
            > Howard LeWine of Harvard Health Blog, reported by npr.org
        + Yes, this points to an association (in my opinion)
+ Causality: Does eating chocolate cause a reduction in heart disease?
    + causality
    + This question is often harder to answer.
        > [The study] doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between chocolate and reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.  
        > JoAnn Manson, chief of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston

## Lec 2.2 Association

### Notes

+ Example: London, early 1850's
    + satirical magazine Punch and notice that it's called "A Court for King Cholera."
    + people did try to explain how diseases were spread, and the leading cause was bad smell.
    + miasmas, miasmatism, miasmatists
        + bad smells given off by waste and rotten matter
        + Believed to be the main source of disease
        + Suggestion remedies:
            + "fly to clean air"
            + "a pocket full o'posies"
            + "fire off barrels of gunpowder"
        + Staunch believers:
        + Florence Nightingale, Edwin Chadwick, Commissioner of General Board of Health
    + John Snow, 1813-1858
        + curlpit: dirty water drinking
        + pump and people died

## Lec 2.3 Causation

### Notes

+ Comparisons
    + treatment group
    + control group - doe not receive the treatment

+ Snow's "Great Experiment"
    > "... there is no difference whatever in the houses or the people receiving the supply of the two Water Companies, or in any of the physical conditions with which they are surrounded ..."
    + The two groups were similar apart from the treatment.

+ Snow's Table --> death rate more important than deaths

    | Supply Area | Number of houses | Cholera deaths | Deaths per 10,000 houses |
    |-------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
    | S&V | 40,046 | 1,263 | 315 |
    | Lambeth | 26,107 | 98 | 37 |
    | Rest of London | 256,423 | 1,422 | 59 |

+ Key to establishing causality

    If the treatment and control groups are _similar apart from the treatment_, then differences between the outcomes in the two groups can be ascribed to the treatment.

## Lec 2.4 Confounding

### Notes

+ Trouble  
    If the treatment and control groups have __systematic differences other than the treatment.__ then it might be difficult to identify causality.

    Such differences are often present in __observational studies__.

    When the lead research astray, they are called __confounding factors.__

+ Randomize!
    + If you assign individuals to treatment and control __at random__, then the two groups are likely to be similar apart from the treatment.
    + You can account - mathematically - for variability in the assignment.
    + __Randomized Controlled Experiment__

+ Careful ...  
    Regardless of what the dictionary says, in probability theory

    __Random $\neq$ Haphazard__ (haphazard: not in order)
