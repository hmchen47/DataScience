# Section 2: Cause and Effect

## Lec 2.1 Questions

### Notes

+ Observation
    + __individuals__, study subjects, participants, units
        + Eurpoean adults
    + treatment
        + chocolate consumption
    + outcome
        + heart disease
+ Association: Is there __any relation__ between chocolate consumption and heart disease?
    + association
        + any realtion
        + link
    + Answer:
        + Some data: 
            > Among those in the top of chocolate consumption, 12 percent developed or died of cardiovascular disease during the study, compared to 17.4 percent of those who didn't eat chocolate.  
            > Howard LeWine of Harvard Health Blog, reported by npr.org
        + Yes, this points to an association (in my opinion)
+ Causality: Does eating chocolate cause a reduction in heart disease?
    + causality
    + This question is often harder to answer.
        > [The study] doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between chocolate and reduced risk of heart disease and stroke.  
        > JoAnn Manson, chief of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston

## Lec 2.2 Association

### Notes

+ Example: London, early 1850's
    + satirical magazine Punch and notice that it's called "A Court for King Cholera."
    + people did try to explain how diseases were spread, and the leading cause was bad smell.
    + miasmas, miasmatism, miasmatists
        + bad smells given off by waste and rotten matter
        + Believed to be the main source of disease
        + Suggestion remedies:
            + "fly to clean air"
            + "a pocket full o'posies"
            + "fire off barrels of gunpowder"
        + Staunch believers:
        + Florence Nightingale, Edwin Chadwick, Commissioner of General Board of Health
    + John Snow, 1813-1858
        + curlpit: dirty water drinking
        + pump and people died

## Lec 2.3 Causation

### Notes

+ Comparisons
    + treatment group
    + control group - doe not receive the treatment

+ Snow's "Great Experiment"
    > "... there is no difference whatever in the houses or the people receiving the supply of the two Water Companies, or in any of the physical conditions with which they are surrounded ..."
    + The two groups were similar apart from the treatment.

+ Snow's Table --> death rate more important than deaths

    | Supply Area | Number of houses | Cholera deaths | Deaths per 10,000 houses |
    |-------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
    | S&V | 40,046 | 1,263 | 315 |
    | Lambeth | 26,107 | 98 | 37 |
    | Rest of London | 256,423 | 1,422 | 59 |

+ Key to establishing causality

    If the treatment and control groups are _similar apart from the treatment_, then differences between the outcomes in the two groups can be ascribed to the treatment.

## Lec 2.4 Confounding

### Notes

+ Trouble  
    If the treatment and control groups have __systematic differences other than the treatment.__ then it might be difficult to identify causality.

    Such differences are often present in __observational studies__.

    When the lead research astray, they are called __confounding factors.__

+ Randomize!
    + If you assign individuals to treatment and control __at random__, then the two groups are likely to be similar apart from the treatment.
    + You can account - mathematically - for variability in the assignment.
    + __Randomized Controlled Experiment__

+ Careful ...  
    Regardless of what the dictionary says, in probability theory

    __Random $\neq$ Haphazard__ (haphazard: not in order)

## Reading and Practice for Section 2

This guide assumes you have watched the Section 2 videos.

This corresponds to textbook section:

Chapter 2: [Causality and Experiments](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/causality-and-experiments.html) 

In this section, we learned about causality and experiments.  Some terms and concepts with which you should now be familiar  include association, causation, treatment and control groups, and confounding factors.  

Try applying what you learned to a real example in the next problem.

## Practice for Section 2

A study at UCLA investigated factors that might result in greater attention to the health and education of girls in rural India. One such factor is information about job opportunities for women. The idea is that if people know that educated women can get good jobs, they might take more care of the health and education of girls in their families, as an investment in the girlsâ€™ future potential as earners.

The study focused on 160 villages outside the capital of India, all with little access to information about call centers and similar organizations that offer job opportunities to women. In 80 of the villages chosen at random, recruiters visited the village, described the opportunities, recruited women who had some English language proficiency and experience with computers, and provided ongoing support free of charge for three years. In the other 80 villages, no recruiters visited and no other intervention was made.

At the end of the study period, the researchers recorded data about the school attendance and health of the children in the villages.

Q1. Which statement best describes the treatment and control groups for this study?

    a. The treatment group was the 80 villages visited by recruiters, and the control group was the other 80 villages with no intervention.
    b.The treatment group was the 160 villages selected, and the control group was the rest of the villages outside the capital of India.
    c. The treatment group was the girls in India, and the control group was the boys in India.
    d. There is no clear notion of treatment and control group in this study.

    Ans: a

Q2. Was this an observational study, a randomized controlled experiment or a randomized observational study?

    a. This was an observational study.
    b. This was a randomized controlled experiment.
    c. This was a randomized observational study.

    Ans: b

Q3. The study found that "Girls aged 5-15 in villages that received the recruiting services were 3 to 5 percentage points more likely to be in school." Does the study provide evidence that receiving recruting services leads to an increase in the chance that girls are in school?

    a. Yes, the study provides evidence of a causal link.
    b. No, the study does not provide evidence for causation because of confounding factors.
    c. There is not enough information to tell.

    Ans: a
