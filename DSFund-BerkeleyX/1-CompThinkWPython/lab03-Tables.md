# Lab 3: Tables (Jupyter Notebook)

Lab 3 is all about tables.

Please complete Lab 3 by the end of Sunday, April 29 ( 11:59PM Anywhere on Earth ) to receive a score. We suggest you complete Lab 3 by the end of Sunday, April 22 to keep up with the pace of the course, but submissions will be accepted until Sunday, April 29.

You can verify that you will receive full credit by running the final cell in the lab notebook, but your score may not update in the Progress tab for a few days after you complete the lab. 

If you choose not to use Jupyter notebooks for the course for accessibility reasons, you can instead complete the Alternative Lab 3 in the next section. It's the same assignment in a different format. If you can use Jupyter notebooks, then please complete this version only, and you will be done with this week's required assignments.
