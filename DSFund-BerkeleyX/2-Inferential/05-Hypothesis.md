# Section 5: Hypothesis Testing (Lec 5.1 - Lec 5.4)

## Lec 5.1 Assessing Models

### Notes

+ Choosing One of Two Viewpoints

    + Based on data
        + “Chocolate has no effect on cardiac disease.” --> “Yes, it does.”
        + “This jury panel was selected at random from eligible jurors.” --> “No, it has too many people with college degrees.”

+ Models
    + A model is a set of assumptions aboyut the data
    + In data science, many models involve assumption about processes that involve randomnes, e.g., “Chance models”

+ Approach to Assessment

    + If we can simulate data according to the assumptions of the model, we can learn what the model predicts.
    + We can then compare the predictions to the data that were observed.
    + If the data and the model’s predictions are not consistent, that is evidence against the model.
