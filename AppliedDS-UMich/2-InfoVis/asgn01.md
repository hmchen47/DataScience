For each mechanism that you identify, you will explain how it was used to mislead.

### Step-By-Step Assignment Instructionsless

1. Read Alberto Cairoâ€™s work, Graphics Lies, Misleading Visuals

Hint: You may want to use google or bing image search with a parameter such as "information visualization", or "scientific poster chart" or similar in order to find visualizations to critique. You might also want to consider looking on the subreddits [dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) or [dataisugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/).
