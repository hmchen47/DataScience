## Introduction

+ D. Scott, "On optimal and data-based histograms," Biometrika, 66:605{610, 1979.
    + A formula for the optimal histogram bin width which asymptotically minimizes the integrated mean squared error
    + Since the underlying density is usually unknown, it is not immediately clear how one should apply this in practice.
    + Using the Gaussian density as a reference standard, which leads to the data-based choice for the bin width of $a \times s \times n^{-1/3}$, where $a = 3.49$ and $s$ is an estimate of the standard deviation.
    + For real data sets histograms based on __5-20 bins__ usually suffice.

+ Mats Rudemo, "Empirical choice of histograms and kernel density estimators", Scandinavian J. of Stat., 9:65-78, 1982
    + a cross-validation technique for selecting the number of bins
    + large sampling variation
