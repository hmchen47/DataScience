### Assignment 4

Before working on this assignment please read these instructions fully. In the submission area, you will notice that you can click the link to **Preview the Grading** for each step of the assignment. This is the criteria that will be used for peer grading. Please familiarize yourself with the criteria before beginning the assignment.

This assignment requires that you to find **at least** two datasets on the web which are related, and that you visualize these datasets to answer a question with the broad topic of **weather phenomena** (see below) for the region of **Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States**, or **United States** more broadly.

You can merge these datasets with data from different regions if you like! For instance, you might want to compare **Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States** to Ann Arbor, USA. In that case at least one source file must be about **Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States**.

You are welcome to choose datasets at your discretion, but keep in mind **they will be shared with your peers**, so choose appropriate datasets. Sensitive, confidential, illicit, and proprietary materials are not good choices for datasets for this assignment. You are welcome to upload datasets of your own as well, and link to them using a third party repository such as github, bitbucket, pastebin, etc. Please be aware of the Coursera terms of service with respect to intellectual property.

Also, you are welcome to preserve data in its original language, but for the purposes of grading you should provide english translations. You are welcome to provide multiple visuals in different languages if you would like!

As this assignment is for the whole course, you must incorporate principles discussed in the first week, such as having as high data-ink ratio (Tufte) and aligning with Cairo’s principles of truth, beauty, function, and insight.

Here are the assignment instructions:

 * State the region and the domain category that your data sets are about (e.g., **Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States** and **weather phenomena**).
 * You must state a question about the domain category and region that you identified as being interesting.
 * You must provide at least two links to available datasets. These could be links to files such as CSV or Excel files, or links to websites which might have data in tabular form, such as Wikipedia pages.
 * You must upload an image which addresses the research question you stated. In addition to addressing the question, this visual should follow Cairo's principles of truthfulness, functionality, beauty, and insightfulness.
 * You must contribute a short (1-2 paragraph) written justification of how your visualization addresses your stated research question.

What do we mean by **weather phenomena**?  For this category you might want to consider seasonal changes, natural disasters, or historical trends.

### Tips
* Wikipedia is an excellent source of data, and I strongly encourage you to explore it for new data sources.
* Many governments run open data initiatives at the city, region, and country levels, and these are wonderful resources for localized data sources.
* Several international agencies, such as the [United Nations](http://data.un.org/), the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/), the [Global Open Data Index](http://index.okfn.org/place/) are other great places to look for data.
* This assignment requires you to convert and clean datafiles. Check out the discussion forums for tips on how to do this from various sources, and share your successes with your fellow students!

### Example
Looking for an example? Here's what our course assistant put together for the **Ann Arbor, MI, USA** area using **sports and athletics** as the topic. [Example Solution File](./notebooks/Assignment4_example.pdf)

## Peer-graded Assignment: Becoming an Independent Data Scientist

### Instruction

This assignment requires that you identify at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. You will state a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question. You will then be asked to justify how your visual addresses your research question.

As this assignment is for the whole course, you must incorporate and defend the principles discussed in the first week and align with Cairo’s principles of truth, beauty, function, and insight.

In this assignment the focus is more on the mechanics of creating charts, so there is no requirement to create an enlightening chart as described by Cairo. But to explore the issue, please provide comments to the learner on the following:
1. Did the chart created teach you something new about the city/region/country? What did you learn?
2. Do you think this chart answers an interesting question? Why?
3. Name one thing which works and one which could be improved, and how would you improve it.

+ Discussion

    The figures illustrates the occurrences and size of wildfire in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, from 1996 to 2014.  The sources of the wildfire historical data are gathered from Provincial governments.  For Alberta, the historical data is divided into a couple of files while British Columbia's data from as early as 1900.  Meanwhile, Alberta's data contains more fields of information than BC one.  However, We cannot find a metadata for Alberta's dataset while BC's data is more straight forward.  After using the definition of fire class and fire size, we can decide to use 'uc_hectares' field as the appropriate one for fire size.

    The plot compares these two provinces' wildfire occurrences (left y-axis scale x 1000) and aggregated fire size in hectares (right y-axis scale x 1000).  Two line graphs represent the occurrences of wildfire while two side-by-side bar charts for each year indicate the aggregated fire size.  In general, we can conclude that BC had more wildfire occurrences while Alberta had larger fire size except for year 2003, 2009, 2010, and 2014.  Derived from the information, we can draw a rough conclusion that BC had much more small wildfire occurrences while Alberta had larger damage by each occurrence.

+ Cairo’s principles
    + Truthfulness
        1. The datasets are gather from the government's open data
        2. All data are simple counts and summarization.  
        3. Comparisons are based on the datasets

    + Beauty
        1. The aggregated fire size of each province are illustrated side-by-side for comparison.
        2. The occurrences of wildfire are depicted with line graphs for comparison.
        3. The scales of line graphs and bar charts are displayed on each side of the figure.

    + Functionality
        1. The line graphs show the occurrences of each province from 1999-2014 and indicates BC had more wildfire occurrences than Alberta.
        2. The bar charts indicate that Alberta had far more damages than BC, except for a couple of individual years.
        3. British Columbia had more fluctuated occurrences than Alberta.
        4. Occurrence of huge wildfire size happened more in Alberta.

    + Insightfulness
        1. The wildfire in Alberta was harder to control than BC.
        2. British Columbia had far more wildfire caused by Residential.
        3. In average, Alberta has larger fire size than BC.

+ This visualization was concerned with answering the question of how much people is displaced by floods each year compared to the total poblation displaced in the united states, the data was taken from data.world site and it shows that the total poblation displaced has 3 high points but floods aren't a very big part of the total in general, but in 2013 it was a peak and mostly of the displaced people were because of floods
+ Principles
    + My visual respects the principle of truthfulness because it is not misleading with its data.
    + My visual respects the principle of beauty because it respects design patterns and intends to be visual friendly.
    + My visual respects the principle of functionality because it is comprehensive.
    + My visual respects the principle of insightfulness because it gives functional information.

### Review #2

+ Central America; Migration to US
+ Are the high murder rates in the originating countries the reason for the migration of unaccompanied children?
+ Links
    + https://dataunodc.un.org/sites/dataunodc.un.org/files/homicide_report_total_and_sex.xlsx
    + https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/about/ucs/facts-and-data#countryoforigin 
+ Justification

    The data provided by the data sets in the two links had five years and 5 countries in common: 2012 - 2016 and the countries El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia. In the case migration data, Colombia was lumped with well over a 190 countries under the label "All Others". However, the numbers were so small in comparison to those of the first 4 countries listed above, I adopted them as numbers for Colombia.

    The visuals show murder rates and migration percents for El Salvador and Colombia. The El Salvador chart supports the hypothesis that high murder rates encourage the migration in question, whereas the Colombia chart disagrees with it. Data for Honduras and Guatemala is similar to that of El Salvador. This suggests that whereas high homicidal rates may be a factor in migration, there may be other factors as well. For example, proximity of the country to the US, Economy of the country, etc.

+ Principles:
    + Charts must reflect the data and should not be allowed to draw false conclusions.
    + Simple uncluttered and visually pleasing charts are the best.
    + Must present information ina way to grasp it quickly for possible followup actions.
    + Conclusions should be straightforward and allow for visibility into information hidden in the data,

### Review #4

+ Beijing, China.; Temperature in Beijing against Global Surface Ocean temperature in each month.
+ Whether there is a correlation between temperature in Beijing against Global Ocean Surface temperature in each month.
+ Datasets

    2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/global-temp/master/data/monthly.csv

+ This project deals with whether there is a correlation between temperature in Beijing against Global Surface temperature in each month. We have used data from 2000 to 2015 and found that no correlation exists between the two and hence conclude china is not the sole major contributor to the surface ocean temperature.

### Review #4

+ Eastern United States, Metropolitan NHL division
+ Compare Points gained in NHL seasons 1975-2018 between Washington Capitals and their biggest rival Pittsburgh Penguins
+ Data
    + ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Washington_Capitals_seasons
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pittsburgh_Penguins_seasons
+ Justification

    The purpose of this visualization was to compare Points that are awarded for each game won gained in NHL seasons 1975-2018 between Washington Capitals and their biggest rival Pittsburgh Penguins. The source of the data was Wikipedia pages listing NHL seasons for each team. A 5 year moving average was was plotted in helping to visualize the data trends. The 2005 and 2013 seasons where dropped from the data due to the NHL lockouts since those years affected the number of games played. They year at which the comparison has begun is 1975 at which the Capitals started playing in the NHL. Penguins are an older team and started playing in the NHL in 1968 which is not shown on the graph.

    In the first 7 years Capitals as the new team in the NHL were catching up to the points the Penguins had. Capitals managed to surpass the number of points the Penguins had from around 1983 till around 1991. After that both teams hand relatively similar scores with interchanging periods of one team having more points than the other. What is interesting is that in some periods like around 1994 till around 1998 the increase or decrease of points happened simultaneously for both teams while the Penguins maintained a higher number of points over the Capitals.

+ Principles:
    + Truthfulness: Data taken directly from the source. The 2005 and 2013 seasons where dropped from the data due to the NHL lockouts - those years that affected the number of games played - depicting them would have gave the wrong impression in terms of a much lower number of points scored. The y-axis has not been cut and is starting from 0 points to show the appropriate scale. The x-axis shows years in 5 year intervals for readability. No other modification has been done to the data.
    + Functionality: The seasons have been adjusted from the format say 2017-2018 to 2018 for readability purposes. The x-axis shows years in 5 year intervals for readability and identifying trends and not for specific year to NHL points comparisons. The alpha values on the axis, labels, lines have been adjusted for visibility purposes. The top and left spine have been set to not visible. The choice of line colors for Capitals and Penguins was based on the primary colors of these teams which aids familiarity. Provided label, removed the label border, adjusted placement. Set figure size to better show the image.
    + Beauty: adjusted the colors and alpha values of the labels and line charts. Line colors were adjusted and chosen to represent the primary team colors of the teams. Removed the top an left spine to make the image more visually pleasing.
    + Insightfulness: The line plot is useful for depicting trends across a period of time. The plot shows that form the most part both teams usually have very similar NHL seasons. This is not true in the initial time period when the Capitals were a new team in NHL and did not get that many points. Also the time period around 1985 showing Penguins decline does not relate to the general trend.
