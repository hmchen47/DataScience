# Leakage in Data Mining: Formulation, Detection, and Avoidance

Authors: S. Kaufman, S. Rosset, & C. Perlich


## Introduction

+ __Leakage__ in data mining (henceforth leakage) is essentially the introduction of information about the data mining target, which should not be legitimately available to mine from.

+ The introduction of this illegitimate information is unintentional, and facilitated by the data collection, aggregation and preparation process.

+ Leakage is undesirable as it may lead a __modeler__ to learn a suboptimal solution, which would in fact be outperformed in deployment by a leakage-free model that could have otherwise been built. At the very least leakage leads to overestimation of the model's performance.

+ Attempts to fix leakage resulted in the introduction of new leakage which is even harder to deal with.
