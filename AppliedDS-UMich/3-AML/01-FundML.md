# Module 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning - Intro to SciKit Learn

## Course Syllabus

### Prerequisites

In order to be successful in this course, you will need to know how to program in Python. The expectation is that you have completed [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis) and [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting), so that you are familiar with the numpy and pandas Python libraries for data manipulation, and matplotlib for plotting.

### Week by week

__In Module One__, you will be introduced to basic machine learning concepts, tasks, and workflow using an example classification problem based on the K-nearest neighbors method, and implemented using the scikit-learn library. This week’s assignment has you work through the process of loading and examining a dataset, training a k-nearest neighbors classifier on the dataset, and then evaluating the accuracy of the classifier and using it to classify new data.

__In Module Two__, you will delve into a wider variety of supervised learning methods for both classification and regression, learning about the connection between model complexity and generalization performance, the importance of proper feature scaling, and how to control model complexity by applying techniques like regularization to avoid overfitting. In addition to k-nearest neighbors, this week covers linear regression (least-squares, ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression), logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and the use of cross-validation for model evaluation. For this week’s assignment, you’ll explore the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by looking at the effect of key parameters on the accuracy of different classification and regression models.

__In Module Three__, you will cover evaluation and model selection methods that you can use to help understand and optimize the performance of your machine learning models. For this week’s assignment, you will train a classifier to detect fraudulent financial transactions, analyze its performance with different evaluation metrics, and then optimize the classifier’s performance based on different evaluation metrics, depending on the goals of the detection task (e.g. to minimize false positives vs false negatives).

__In Module Four__, you will cover more advanced supervised learning methods that include ensembles of trees (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks (with an optional summary on deep learning). You will also learn about the critical problem of data leakage in machine learning and how to detect and avoid it. The final assignment brings everything together: you will design features for, and build your own classifier on, a prediction problem on a complex real-world dataset.

### Enrollment Options

Coursera has made the decision to make Specializations available by monthly subscription. This means you can choose to pay a monthly fee to access all of the courses in a specific Specialization.

Coursera’s switch to monthly subscriptions comes with another change -- for those learners who choose the “Audit Only” enrollment, you will no longer be able to submit assignments for grades nor see answers for those assignments. You will still have access to all the course materials but you will not be graded on your work, nor see answers to graded assignments.

For further information on the different enrollment options for Coursera courses, please visit the [Enrollment Options Help](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818613-Enrollment-options) page. If you have feedback about the enrollment options shared on the Enrollment Options page, you can share your thoughts with Coursera in this [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/65DPLHG).

### Grading and Assignments

The lectures will provide you with some guidance for completing assignments, but you will need to take initiative and look beyond assignment instructions in order to be successful. You'll need to know how to ask questions in the discussion forums of your peers, and seek out new information through web searches and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib). Be sure to also check out the [Additional Resources](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning/resources/NJFSV).

If you are not sure what kind of output is required, or think there is a need for more clarity, please head to the course discussion forums. Note that some assignments and in video quizzes may not be mobile friendly.

Some assignments allow you to download and view your fellow learner’s code and/or data. If you want to look at the learner's code, we recommend that you open it through the Jupyter notebook system on the Coursera platform as that will be more secure. Please ensure that all data you share is publicly available, since you will be sharing these data with other learners.

| Course Item | Percentage of Final Grade | Passing Threshold |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Week 1 Quiz | 5% | 80% |
| Week 1 Jupyter Notebook Assignment | 15% |
| Week 2 Quiz | 5% | 80% |

### In-Video Questions (IVQs)

In this course, in-video questions or IVQs may appear during lectures to help you learn as well as assess your understanding of the content. IVQs are optional and do not count towards your overall course grade.

#### Types of in-video questions

Many of the lectures contain in-video questions (IVQs). These questions are presented in a variety of formats. Some will ask you to write or think about a concept from the video. Others will ask for a short answer. Still others may ask you to choose from a multiple-choice list of answers. If an IVQ is a survey or a poll, you will see a summary of responses from other learners after you respond. You can look at the question again later to see new summary data as more of your peers answer.

Some IVQs also contain runnable code blocks. These IVQs allow you to practice the coding concepts during the lecture. In this course, these types of IVQs will usually be directly followed with the solution code.

### Recommended Text

The following book is not required to complete the course, but we recommend it as an additional resource that may be useful to you as you progress, and for later reference. Like this course, the book focuses on the practical details of building your own solutions to machine learning tasks using scikit-learn in Python. It provides further background on machine learning concepts, more depth on specific topics covered in this course (as well as a number of additional topics), and additional coding examples.

    + Provides fundamental data structures used by `scikit-learn`, particularly multi-dimensional arrays.
    + Typically, data that is input to `scikit-learn` will be in the form of a NumPy array.
    + Example import: `import numpy as np`

+ [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/): Data Manipulation and Analysis
    + Provides key data structures like `DataFrame`
    + Also, support for reading/writing data in different formats
    + Example import: `import pandas as pd`

+ [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and other plotting libraries
