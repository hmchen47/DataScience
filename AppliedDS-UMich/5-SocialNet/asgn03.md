    Hi everyone,

    We just revised the instructions for Question 2, 3 and 4 and the wording of Question 4 to make Assignment 3 clear. The instructions and questions have been reworded to the following (The major differences are marked in bold below).

    For Questions 2, 3, and 4, assume that you do not know anything about the structure of the network, except for the all the centrality values of the nodes. That is, use one of the covered centrality measures to rank the nodes and find the most appropriate candidate.

    Question 4

    Assume the restriction on the voucher’s travel distance is still removed, but now a competitor has developed a strategy to remove a person from the network in order to disrupt the distribution of your company’s voucher. Your competitor is specifically targeting people who are often bridges of information flow between other pairs of people. Identify the single riskiest person to be removed under your competitor’s strategy?

    Please note that these modifications aim to direct you to figure out the correct answer that is consistent with the desired result in grader. If you have already passed the grader for this question, you don't need to resubmit it.

    Learners who opened this assignment first time will directly see the latest version. For those who have viewed previous versions and want to get the latest version, you may need to reset your notebook. Please go to "Resources"-"Jupyter Notebook FAQ Page"-"6. How do I reset my notebook?" if you have no idea on how to do that.

    Thanks a lot to learners who pointed these out.

    Best,

    Team of Applied Social Network Analysis in Python
