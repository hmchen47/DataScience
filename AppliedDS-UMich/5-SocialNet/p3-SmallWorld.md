## Six Degrees of Separation

+ Social networks: serve as conduits by which ideas and innovations flow through groups of people

+ Basic structure issue
    + these groups can be connected by very short paths through the social network
    + Using short paths to reach others who are social distant, engaging in a kind of "focused" search that is much more targeted than the broad spreading pattern exhibited by the diffusion of information or a new behavior

+ Small-worl phenomenon or "Six-degree of separation"
    + Stanley Milgram: randomly chosen "starter" individuals to each try forwarding aa letter to a designated "target" person living in the town of Sharon, MA, a suburb of Boston
    + Roughly $1/3$ letters eventually arrived at the target, in a median of six steps
    A basic experimental evidence for the existence of short paths in the global friendship network, linking all (or almost all) of us together in society.
    + Two striking facts:
        1. abundant short paths
        2. effective at collectively finding these short paths without any sort of global "map" of this network

+ Forwarding strategies
    + The real global friendship network contains enough clues about how people fit together in the larger structures to allow the preocess of search to focus in on distant targets.
    + People employ for choosing how to forward a message toward a targets.
    + Killworth and Bernard: a mixture of primarily geographical and occupational features being used, with different features being favored depending on the characteristics of the target in relation to the sender.
    + People are most successful at finding paths when the target is high-status and socially accessible.
