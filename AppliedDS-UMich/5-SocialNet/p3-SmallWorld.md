## Six Degrees of Separation

+ Social networks: serve as conduits by which ideas and innovations flow through groups of people

+ Basic structure issue
    + these groups can be connected by very short paths through the social network
    + Using short paths to reach others who are social distant, engaging in a kind of "focused" search that is much more targeted than the broad spreading pattern exhibited by the diffusion of information or a new behavior

+ Small-worl phenomenon or "Six-degree of separation"
    + Stanley Milgram: randomly chosen "starter" individuals to each try forwarding aa letter to a designated "target" person living in the town of Sharon, MA, a suburb of Boston
    + Roughly $1/3$ letters eventually arrived at the target, in a median of six steps
    A basic experimental evidence for the existence of short paths in the global friendship network, linking all (or almost all) of us together in society.
    + Two striking facts:
        1. abundant short paths
        2. effective at collectively finding these short paths without any sort of global "map" of this network

+ Forwarding strategies
    + The real global friendship network contains enough clues about how people fit together in the larger structures to allow the preocess of search to focus in on distant targets.
    + People employ for choosing how to forward a message toward a targets.
    + Killworth and Bernard: a mixture of primarily geographical and occupational features being used, with different features being favored depending on the characteristics of the target in relation to the sender.
    + People are most successful at finding paths when the target is high-status and socially accessible.



## Structure and Randomness

+ Models for the existence of short paths
    + short paths are at lease compatible with intitution

The average person has between 500 and 1500 acquaintances, leading to 5002 = 25K in one step, 5003 = 125M in two steps, 5004 = 62.5B in four (Figure (a)). However, the effect of triadic closure works to limit the number of people you can reach by following short paths (Figure (b)). Triadic closure: If two people in a social network have a friend in common, then there is an increased likelihood that they will become friends themselves at some point in the future. Question: Can we make up a simple model that exhibits both of the features: many closed triads (high clustering), but also very short path (small-world)?" title="Social networks expand to reach many people in only a few steps." height="300">

    + Exponential growth: the numbers are growing by powers of 100 with each step, bringing us to 100 million after four steps, and 10 billion after five steps.
    + The effect of triadic closure in social networks works to limit the number of people when reaching by following short paths.
    + The social network appears from the local perspective of any one individual to be highly clustered, not the kind of massively branching structure that would more obviously reach many nodes along very short paths.

+ The Watts-Strogatz Model
    + A model follows naturally from a combination of two basic social-network idea: (Chapters 3 & 4)
        1. __homophily__: the principle that connect to others who are like ourselves
        2. __weak ties__: the links to acquaintances that connect us to parts of the network that would otherwise be far away
    + Homophily creates many triangles while the weak ties still produce the kind of widely branching structure that reaches many nodes in a few steps.

    </a>
    + The set of nodes arranged on a grid: two nodes are one grid step apart if they are directly adjacent to each other in either the horizontal or vertical direction.
    + Two kinds of links:
        + Homophily captured by having each node form a link to all other nodes that lie within radius of up to $r$ grid steps away, for some constant value of $r$.
        + The links formed to similar people.
    + For some other constant value $k$, each node also forms a link to $k$ other nodes selected uniformly at random from the grid.
    + Fig.20.2 (b), a schematic picture of the resulting network: a hybrid structure consisting of a small amount of randomness (the weak ties) sprinkled onto an underlying structured pattern (the homophilous links).
    + Obgservation: the network has many triangles - any two neighboring nodes (or nearby nodes) will have many common friends, where their neighborhoods of radius $r$ overlap, and this produces many triangles.
    + With high probability, very short paths connecting every pair of nodes in the network.
    + Start tracing paths outward from a starting node $v$, using only the $k$ random weak ties out of each node.
    + Since these edges link to nodes chosen uniformly at random, very unlikely to ever see a node twice in the first few steps toward from $v$.
    + Only allow one out of every $k$ nodes to have a _single_ random friend -- keeping the proximity-based edges as before.
    + Conceptually group $k \times k$ subsquares of the grid into "towns".
    + Consider the small-world phenomenon at the level of towns.  Each town contains approximately $k$ people who each have a random friend.
    + The town collectively has $k$ links to other towns selected uniformly at random.
    + Find a short path between any two people: 
        1. find a short path between the two towns they inhabit
        2. use the proximity-based edges to turn this into an actual path in the network on individual people
    + The crux of the Watts-Strogatz model: introducing a tiny amount of randomness, in the form of long-range weak-ties, is enough to make the world "small," with short paths between every pair of nodes.
