+ Degree Distributions
    + The __degree__ of a node in an undirected graph is the number of neighbors it has. Eg., A(3), B(2), C(3), D(2), E(1_, F(3), G(4), H(2), I(2)
    + The __degree distribution__ of a graph is the probability distribution of the degrees over the entire network.
    + The degree distribution, $ùëÉ(ùëò)$ of this network has the following values:

        $$P(1) = \frac{1}{9}, P(2) = \frac{4}{9}, P(3)=\frac{1}{3}, P(4) = \frac{1}{9}$$
        + $k$: the degree of a given node
    + Plot of the degree distribution of this network:
        ```python
        degrees = G.degree()
        degree_values = sorted(set(degrees.values()))
        histogram = [list(degrees.values()).count(i)/float(nx.number_of_nodes(G)) for i in degree_values]

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.bar(degree_values,histogram)
        plt.xlabel('Degree')
        plt.ylabel('Fraction of Nodes')
        plt.show()

+ In-Degree Distributions
    + The __in-degree__ of a node in a directed graph is the number of in-links it has.
    + E.g. graph above - A(3), B(1), C(2), D(1), E(0), F(1), G(1), H(0), I(2)
    + The in-degree distribution, $P_{in}(k)$, of this network has the following values:

        $$P_{in}(0)=\frac{2}{9}, P_{in}(1)=\frac{4}{9}, P_{in}(2)=\frac{2}{9}, P_{in}(3)=\frac{1}{9}$$

There are two things to notice about these degree distributions. The first thing is that they're all in log-log scale, meaning that the x-axis and the y-axis are both on log scale rather than linear scale. The second thing to notice is that, for at least part of these distributions, they tend to look like straight lines for all three cases. When you put those two things together when you have a degree distribution on a log-log scale and it looks kind of like a straight line, then we say that this degree distribution looks kind of like a power law. A power law degree distribution would have the form P(k) equals C times k to the negative alpha, where C and alpha are constant, and the alpha values for these three distributions that we have here are 2.3 for A, 2.1 for B, and four for C" title="Examples of power law distribution" height="250">

+ Modeling Networks
    + Networks with power law distribution have many nodes with small degree and a few nodes with very large degree.
    + What could explain power law degree distribution we observe in many networks?
    + Can we find a set of basic assumptions that explain this phenomenon?

+ Preferential Attachment Model
    + Start with two nodes connected by an edge.
    + At each time step, add a new node with an edge connecting it to an existing node.
    + Choose the node to connect to at random with probability proportional to each node‚Äôs degree.
    + The probability of connecting to a node $u$ of degree:
    
        $$k_u = k_u/\sum_j k_j$$
    + As the number of nodes increases, the degree distribution of the network under the preferential attachment model approaches the power law $ùëÉ(k) = Ck^{-3}$ with constant $ùê∂$.
    + The preferential attachment model produces networks with degree distributions similar to real networks.
    + `barabasi_albert_graph(n, m)` returns a network with $n$ nodes. Each new node attaches to $m$ existing nodes according to the Preferential Attachment model.
        ```python
        G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(1000000, 1)
        degrees = G.degree()
        degree_values = sorted(set(degrees.values()))
        histogram = [list(degrees.values().count(i))/float(nx.number_of_nodes(G)) for i in degree_values]

        plt.plot(degree_values,histogram, 'o')

You can use this function in Network X to create networks that follow these Preferential Attachment Model. Let's create one here with a million nodes and an m(1), so every node attaches to a single existing node. Now, let's plot the degree distribution in the same way that we did before except that now I'm not using a bar plot, I'm using a scatter plot, and now I'm setting the scales, the y-scale and x-scales to be logged so we can see that straight line that gets formed on the log-log scale for the degree distribution." title="IVQ: Preferential Attachment Model w/ 8 nodes" height="200">
        </a>

+ Summary
    + The degree distribution of a graph is the probability distribution of the degrees over the entire network.
    + Many real networks have degree distributions that look like power laws ($P(k) = Ck^{-\alpha}$).
    + Models of network generation allow us to identify mechanisms that give rise to observed patterns in real data.
    + The Preferential Attachment Model produces networks with a power law degree distribution.
    + Use `barabasi_albert_graph(n,m)` to construct a n-node preferential attachment network, where each new node attaches to m existing nodes.

## Small World Networks

### Lecture Notes

+ The Small-World Phenomenon
    + The world is small in the sense that ‚Äúshort‚Äù paths exists between almost any two people.
    + How short are these paths?
    + How can we measure their length?

+ Milgram Small World Experiment: 
    + Set up (1960s)
        + 296 randomly chosen ‚Äústarters‚Äù asked to forward a letter to a ‚Äútarget‚Äù person.
        + Target was a stockbroker in Boston.
        + Instructions for starter:
            + Send letter to target if you know him on a first name basis.
            + If you do not know target, send letter (and instructions) to someone you know on a first name basis who is more likely to know the target.
        + Some information about the target, such as city, and occupation, was provided.
    + Results:
        + 64 out of the 296 letters reached the target.
        + Median chain length was 6 (consistent with the phrase ‚Äúsix degrees of separation‚Äù)
    + Key points:
        + A relatively large percentage (>20%) of letters reached target.
        + Paths were relatively short.
        + People were able to find these short paths.

+ Small World of Instant Message

    + Edges: Users engaged in two-way communication over a one-month period.

+ Small World of Facebook
    + Global network: average path length in 2008 was 5.28 and in 2011 it was 4.74.

+ Clustering Coefficient
    + __Local clustering coefficient of a node__: Fraction of pairs of the node‚Äôs friends that are friends with each other.
        + Facebook 2011: High average CC (decreases with degree)
        + Microsoft Instant Message: Average CC of 0.13.
        + IMDB actor network: Average CC 0.78
    + In a random graph, the average clustering coefficient would be much smaller.

+ Path Length and Clustering
    + Social networks tend to have high clustering coefficient and small average path length. Can we think of a network generative model that has these two properties?
    + How about the Preferential Attachment model?
        ```python
        G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(1000,4)
        print (nx.average_clustering(G))
        # 0.0202859273671
        print (nx.average_shortest_path_length(G))
        # 4.16942942943
        ```
    + What if we vary the number of nodes (ùëõ) or the number of edges per new node (ùëö)?
    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-social-network-analysis/lecture/Iv4e8/small-world-networks"> <br/>
        <img src="images/m4-12.png" alt="text" title="Small World of Facebook [Backstrom et al. 2012]" height="250">
    </a>
        + Small average shortest path: high degree nodes act as hubs and connect many pairs of nodes.
        + For a fixed ùëö, clustering coefficient becomes very small as the number of nodes increases.
        + No mechanism in the Preferential Attachment model favors triangle formation.

+ Small World Model
    + Motivation: Real networks exhibit high clustering coefficient and small average shortest paths. Can we think of a model that achieves both of these properties?
    + Small-world model:
        + Start with a ring of ùëõ nodes, where each node is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors.
        + Fix a parameter $p ‚àà [0,1]$
        + Consider each edge $(u, v)$. With probability $p$, select a node $w$ at random and rewire the edge $(u, v)$ so it becomes $(u, w)$.
    + Example: $k = 2, p = 0.4$

    + Small world network: 1000 nodes, $k = 6$, and $p = 0.04$
    + No power law degree distribution.
    + Since most edges are not rewired, most nodes have degree of $6$.
    + Since edges are rewired uniformly at random, no node accumulated very high degree, like in the preferential attachment model
    + Variants of the small world model in NetworkX:
        + Small world networks can be disconnected, which is sometime undesirable.
    + `connected_watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p, t)` runs `watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p)` up to t times, until it returns a connected small world network.
        + `newman_watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p)` runs a model similar to the small world model, but rather than rewiring edges, new edges are added with probability $p$.

+ Summary
    + Real social networks appear to have small shortest paths between nodes and high clustering coefficient.
    + The preferential attachment model produces networks with small shortest paths but very small clustering coefficient.
    + The small world model starts with a ring lattice with nodes connected to $k$ nearest neighbors (high local clustering), and it rewires edges with probability $p$.
    + For small values of $p$, small world networks have small average shortest path and high clustering coefficient, matching what we observe in real networks.
    + However, the degree distribution of small world networks is not a power law.
    + On NetworkX, you can use `watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p)` (and other variants) to produce small world networks.
