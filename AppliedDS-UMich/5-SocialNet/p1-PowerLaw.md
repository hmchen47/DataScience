# Chapter 18. Power Laws and Rich-Get-Richer Phenomena


## Popularity as a Network Phenomenon

+ __Popularity__
    + a phenomenon characterized by extreme imbalances
    + Extreme imbelances: while almost everyone goes through life known only to people in their immediate social circles, a few people achieve wider visibility, and a very, very few attain global name recognition

+ Using the number of in-links to a Web page as a measure of the page’s popularity

+ Web page popularity question: 

    > As a function of k, what fraction of pages on the Web have k in-links?

+ A Simple Hypothesis: The Normal Distribution
    + normal, or Gaussian, distribution — the so-called “bell curve” — used widely throughout probability and statistics.
    + the __Central Limit Theorem__: any sequence of small independent random quantities, then in the limit their sum (or average) will be distributed according to the normal distribution.

+ Web pages
    + model the link structure of the Web
    + each page decides independently at random whether to link to any other given page
    + the number of in-links to a given page is the sum of many independent random quantities (i.e. the presence or absence of a link from each other page)
    + expect it to be normally distributed
