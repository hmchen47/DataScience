# Introduction to Data Science in Python

## Introduction to Specialization

+ Why Python
    1. It's easy to learn  
        Now the language of coice for 8 of 10 top US computer science programs (Philip Guo, CACM)
    2. Full feature  
        Not just a statistics language, but has full capabilities for data acquistion, cleaning, database, high performance computing, and more
    3. Strong Data Science Libraries  
        The SciPy Ecosystem

+ Course Outline
    1. Prerequisites Python Knowledge
    2. The `pandas` Toolkit
    3. Advanced Querying and Manipulation with `pandas`
    4. Basic Statistical Analysis with `numpy` and `scipy`, and projects

## Syllabus

__Welcome to Applied Data Science with Python!__

### Prerequisites

In order to be successful in this course you need to know how to program in Python. If you have a strong programming background already, the first week will introduce you to the Python programming language, and help you learn important constructs (such as slicing of arrays, and lambda functions) which you might not be used to. If you do not have a strong programming background, or you want to refresh your understanding of Python, we highly recommend the Coursera course [Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python), taught by our colleague Dr. Chuck Severance.

### Grading and Assignments

The goal in this course is to provide you with increasingly challenging assignments, where the first assignment is relatively simple, and by the end of the four weeks you are completing a real-world data science project suitable for putting in a portfolio to show prospective employers. Because of this, the majority of assignments in this course are autograded programming assignments.

All assignments for this course require a 80% grade to pass, but some assignments have questions which build upon earlier questions. If you're not sure what kind of output is required, or think there is a need for more clarity, please head to the course discussion forums. Note that some assignments and in video quizzes may not be mobile friendly.

### Working Offline

While the Coursera platform has an integrated Jupyter Notebook system, you can work offline on your own computer by installing Python 3.5+ and the Jupyter software packages. For more details, consult the [Jupyter Notebook FAQ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/resources/0dhYG).

### Help!

If you're having problems, here are a couple of great places to go for help:

1. If the problem is with the Coursera platform such as verification on assignments, in video quiz problems, or the Jupyter Notebooks, please check out the [Coursera Learner Support Forums](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/requests)
2. If the problem deals with understanding the assignment or how to use the Jupyter Notebooks, please read our [Jupyter Notebook FAQ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/resources/0dhYG) page in the course resources
3. If you have questions with the content of the course, or questions about programming in python or with the toolkits described, you can contact your peers and the course instructors in the discussion forums, or go to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
