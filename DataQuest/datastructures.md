Data Set
========

# Introduction To The Data Set
In an earlier mission, we split a CSV file into rows. We'll be doing the same thing here, so it's useful to think of each line in the data file as a separate row. Each row contains multiple values separated by a comma (,).

The first row in our data is the header row, which contains labels for the values beneath them. As the header row indicates, each row has two values:
Day - A number from 1 to 365 indicating the day of the year. January 1st is 1, and December 31st is 365.
Type of Weather - The type of weather experienced on that day. The values that may appear here include Rain, Sunny, Fog, Fog-Rain, or Thunderstorm.

```python
def clean_text(text_string, special_characters):
    cleaned_string = text_string
    for string in special_characters:
        cleaned_string = cleaned_string.replace(string, "")
    cleaned_string = cleaned_string.lower()
    return(cleaned_string)

def tokenize(text_string, special_characters):
    cleaned_story = clean_text(text_string, special_characters)
    story_tokens = cleaned_story.split(" ")
    return(story_tokens)

misspelled_words = []
clean_chars = [",", ".", "'", ";", "\n"]
tokenized_story = tokenize(story_string, clean_chars)
tokenized_vocabulary = tokenize(vocabulary, clean_chars)

for word in tokenized_story:
    if word not in tokenized_vocabulary:
        misspelled_words.append(word)
```
