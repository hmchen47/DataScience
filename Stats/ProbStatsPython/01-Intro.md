# Topic 1: Introduction to Probability and Statistics

## 1.1 Introduction to Probability and Statistics

### Lecture Notes

+ Why should you care about prob&stat?
  + a powerful tool to deal w/ uncertainty
  + example: Navigation software
    + Certainty: find the _shortest_ route from a to b
    + Uncertainty: find the _fastest_ rout from a to b
  + example: Search engine
    + Certainty: find _all_ web pages that contain the word "Trump", "Hillary"
    + Uncertainty: find the 10 _most relevant_ pages doe the query "trump, Hillary debate"
      + not about certain words appeared
      + about what pages really most relevant up to date
  + example: Insurance company
    + Certainty: if a person w/ life insurance dies, the insurance company has to pay the family $X
    + Uncertainty: what is the minimal life insurance premium such that _the probability_ that the life insurance company will be bankrupt in 10 years is smaller than 1%?

+ What will learn in the course?
  + Navigation and search engine problems are advanced, in this class you will learn the foundations
  + Solve basic problems of reasoning under uncertainty
  + Examples
    + if you flip a coin 100 times, what is the probability of getting at most 10 "heads"?
    + what is the probability of getting a "4 of a kind" hand in poker?

+ Computer science examples
  + If you want to hash 1,000,000 elements and can allow 5 indirections for only 10 elements, how big does the table need to be?
  + Suppose that the expected time between failures for a router in one year.  What is the probability that the router will fail during the first month?

+ Some don't belief in statistics
  
  > I don't believe in statistics.  There are too many factors that can't be measured.  You can't measure a ballplayer's heart. - Red Auerbach, basketball coach

+ Summary
  + Uncertainty is all around us
  + Probability and Statistics provide a rational way o deal w/ uncertainty
