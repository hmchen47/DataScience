## 3.6 Variations


0. Sam tries to find how many 2-letter sequences do not include the letter Q, for example BR or ZZ, but not BQ, or QQ.
  
  First, Sam calculates the total number of 2-letter sequences, allowing all letters, as 26*26=676.
  
  Then Sam calculates the number of disallowed sequences:
  
  There are 26 sequences where a Q is the first letter (e.g. QS), and 26 where Q is the second letter (e.g. BQ).
  
  The total number of disallowed sequences is therefore 26+26=52. Subtracting 52 from 676, Sam deduces that there are 624 two-letter sequences without Q.
  
  Where did Sam go wrong?

  a. Made a multiplication error.<br/>
  b. Made a subtraction error<br/>
  c. Subtracted the sequence QQ from the total twice.<br/>
  d. Nothing, Sam is correct.<br/>
