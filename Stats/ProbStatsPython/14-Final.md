11. (For Fun) Model Selection

  A $k$-piece-constant function is define by $k−1$ thresholds $−100<t_1<t_2<\cdots<t_{k−1}<100$ and $k$ values $a_1,a_2, \dots, a_k$. Let

  \[ f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array} \\  a_1, \quad -100 \le x \lt t_1, \\ a_2, \quad t_1 \le x \lt t_2, \\ \vdots \\ a_i, \quad t_{i - 1} \le x \lt t_i, \\ \vdots \\ a_k, \quad t_{k - 1} \le x \le 100. \end{array} \right. \]

  be a $k$-piece-constant function. Suppose you are given $n$ data points $((x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n))$ each of which is generated in the following way:

  1. first, $x$ is drawn according to the uniform distribution over the range  [−100,100] .
  2. second $y$ is chosen to be $f(x)+\omega$  where $\omega$ is drawn according to the normal distribution $N(0,\sigma)$ 

  You partition the data into a training set and a test set of equal sizes. For each $j=1,2,\dots$ you find the $j$-piece-constant function $g_j$ that minimizes the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) on the training set. Denote by $train(j)$ the RMSE on the training set and by  test(j)  the RMSE on the test set.

  Which of the following statements is correct?

  a. $train(j)$ is a monotonically non-increasing function.
  b. $test(j)$ is a monotonically non-increasing function.
  c. $test(j)$ has a minimum close to $j=k$
  d. $train(j)$ has a minimum close to $j=k$
  e. if $j>n/2$, $train(j)=0$

  Ans: <br/>

### Final Exam Instructions

As a reminder: [Onboarding quiz](https://tinyurl.com/yxr8f8sq) is designed to help you ensure your system is compatible with the online proctoring system. Take the Onboarding quiz well in advance of the deadline to ensure your system is compatible. 

Check your edX Dashboard for your deadline to upgrade and be ID-verified. Please make sure your ID verified status has not expired. Confirm this by checking your verification status on your [edX Dashboard](https://tinyurl.com/ohp47kp).

__Please note__: Only those in the Verified track may complete Onboarding and be allowed to complete proctored assessments during this course, which are required for MicroMasters in Data Science Program.


#### Plan your time wisely

Please ensure you have sufficient time to complete the assessment from start to finish, including time for the software to download. It should take no more than 30 minutes total. 

This Onboarding quiz does not count as part of your grade for this course. Working through the steps in this Onboarding quiz will help you confirm that you have the following:

+ a compatible computer system (must be a modern version of Windows or Mac laptop or desktop operating system)
+ a consistent internet connection
+ a private test room (environment) in which to complete the assessment

Read the rules and system requirements at the following links:

+ [Proctoring System Requirements](https://tinyurl.com/y4vyvrlt)


### Quick Tips

+ Onboarding must be completed at least 5 days prior to the proctored exam.
+ You may only take the Onboarding quiz once.
+ Once you have completed the final, remain connected to the internet until the recordings are completely uploaded to Verificient.


### Accessibility and Accommodation Requests

If you are a learner with disabilities, or need extra time or assistance during a proctored assessment, please request it as soon as possible. It could take a few days to receive and respond to requests, so please do not wait. Please see the Final Exam Disability Request Discussion Board. This is just the practice exam, so don't worry (hint: there's only 3 questions). However, when we get to the final exam, if you have a disability that means you need extra time that falls under UCSD's guidelines (see below), you will be able to request support. 

"A disability may be temporary or permanent in nature, can occur at anytime during a student’s college career and may impact a student’s ability to complete day to day activities such as hearing, seeing, standing, sitting, writing, thinking, or interacting with others. This is also known as a current functional limitation. Disabilities can occur in the following areas: psychological, psychiatric, learning, attention, chronic health, physical, vision, hearing, and acquired brain injury." (p.2, Utilizing Disability Services at UC, San Diego: A Guide for Students, Faculty, and Staff). 


### Ending the Quiz

When you have completed the questions, and if the exam timer has not reached 00:00, click the "End My Exam" button on the exam timer bar.

Once the exam is finished, remain connected to the internet until the recordings are completely uploaded to Verificient. Confirm that you want to quit the ProctorTrack application when you are prompted. If you encountered any problems while completing the Onboarding exam please contact edX Support via the contact us form or Verificient. Contact Verificient by phone at +1 (844) 753-2020.
