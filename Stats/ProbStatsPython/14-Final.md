10. 20% of the items on a production line are defective. Randomly inspect items, and let X1 be the number of inspections till the first defective item is observed, and X5 be the number of inspections till the fifth defective item is observed. In both cases, X1 and X5 include the defective item itself (e.g. if the items are {good,good,defective},X1 is 3 ). Calculate

  a. E(X5),
  b. V(X5),
  c. E(X5|X1=4),
  d. V(X5|X1=4).

11. (For Fun) Model Selection

  A $k$-piece-constant function is define by $k−1$ thresholds $−100<t_1<t_2<\cdots<t_{k−1}<100$ and $k$ values $a_1,a_2, \dots, a_k$. Let

  \[ f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array} \\  a_1, \quad -100 \le x \lt t_1, \\ a_2, \quad t_1 \le x \lt t_2, \\ \vdots \\ a_i, \quad t_{i - 1} \le x \lt t_i, \\ \vdots \\ a_k, \quad t_{k - 1} \le x \le 100. \end{array} \right. \]

  be a $k$-piece-constant function. Suppose you are given $n$ data points $((x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n))$ each of which is generated in the following way:

  1. first, $x$ is drawn according to the uniform distribution over the range  [−100,100] .
  2. second $y$ is chosen to be $f(x)+\omega$  where $\omega$ is drawn according to the normal distribution $N(0,\sigma)$ 

  You partition the data into a training set and a test set of equal sizes. For each $j=1,2,\dots$ you find the $j$-piece-constant function $g_j$ that minimizes the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) on the training set. Denote by $train(j)$ the RMSE on the training set and by  test(j)  the RMSE on the test set.

  Which of the following statements is correct?

  a. $train(j)$ is a monotonically non-increasing function.
  b. $test(j)$ is a monotonically non-increasing function.
  c. $test(j)$ has a minimum close to $j=k$
  d. $train(j)$ has a minimum close to $j=k$
  e. if $j>n/2$, $train(j)=0$
