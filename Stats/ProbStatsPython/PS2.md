3. Every morning, the campus coffeeshop orders the day's croissant supply. The coffeeshop buys each croissant for `$1`, and sells it for `$4`. Experience has shown that the number of croissants customers wish to buy on any given day is distributed uniformly between 0 and 49. Once the coffeeshop runs out of croissants, they cannot sell any more, while on the other hand, all croissants left at the end of the day are given to charity for free.

  How many croissants should the coffeeshop order to maximize their expected profit?

  For example, if the coffeeshop orders 1 croissant, then they spend $1 to buy it, and then with probability 0.02 they don't sell any croissants and with probability 0.98 they sell it and bring in `$4`, hence their expected `$` profit is $0.02 \cdot 0+0.98 \cdot 4−1=2.92$. If the coffeeshop orders 2 croissants, then they spend `$2` to buy them, and then with probability 0.02 they sell nothing, with probability 0.02 they sell 1, and with probability 0.96 they sell both, hence their expected `$` profit is $0.02 \cdot 0+0.02 \cdot 4+0.96 \cdot 8−2=7.76−2=5.76$.
