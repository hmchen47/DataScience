## Syllabus

To receive a MicroMasters Certificate in Data Science you must receive verified certificates in the following courses:

+ Python for Data Science
+ Probability and Statistics in Data Science using Python
+ Machine Learning Fundamentals
+ Big Data Analytics using Spark

Learners who receive their MicroMasters in Data Science Certificate are currently eligible to apply to the [Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University](https://tinyurl.com/yb2tbvmj) and [Masters in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://tinyurl.com/yd4te5cg).  A MicroMasters in Data Science can be converted into a maximum of 100 units in this program as directed by the Curtin program course listing below.

+ MEDA5003 Multidisciplinary Data Visualization and Interpretation (25 credits)
+ STAT5001 Statistical Probability (12.5 credits)
+ STAT5006 Statistical Data Analysis 1 (12.5 credits)
+ ISYS5007 Data Management (25 credits)
+ Elective (25 credits)

However, we are committed to working with other edX University partners to find more programs where our courses help you complete their Masters programs.  As we add more programs where you can get credit, we will add them here and keep you updated.

To earn a certificate for this course, you must become a verified learner 10 days before the end date. If you purchase the program in bundle you receive a discount, but all courses must be completed in 15 months. 


## Introduce Yourself

Learners working toward a Verified Certificate may receive university course credit.  As such, there are a number of differences for those learners compared with those just wishing to audit the course.

Learners working toward a Verified Certificate will have access to:

+ A private learner forum so learners have opportunities to interact with the teaching staff.
+ Additional exercises to work through each week when learning the material.

Grading for learners working toward a Verified Certificate will be as follows:

1. Homework and comprehension quizzes will be automatically graded with feedback generated in real time.
2. The final exam will be proctored online.


### HEY, WAIT!  THIS COURSE'S VERIFIED CERTIFICATE IS PRETTY EXPENSIVE!

It's true -- and you'll find that to be true for all courses in edX's MicroMasters programs.  Why is this?  Well, these courses are selected because they represent Masters level course content at UC San Diego and other edX University Partners.  __By completing our MicroMasters, not just a single course certificate, you indicate to employers and hiring personnel that you have made a significant investment in completing rigorous, Masters-level courses and content.__   So, MicroMasters courses should offer you more.

Also, if you decide you want to do a full Masters degree you can get one faster and less expensively!


### UNIVERSITY COURSE CREDIT

edX's MicroMasters Credential program allows MOOC learners, like you, to get credit towards courses for a Masters degree on various university campuses (affiliated with edX).  

#### Current Masters Options

Currently, learners who successfully earn the MicroMasters Credential are eligible to apply for admission to the __Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University__.

If a learner applies for admission to the Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University, and is accepted, the MicroMasters Credential will count towards 25% (or 100 credits of the 400 credits) of the coursework required for graduation in the Curtin program.

#### Future Masters Options

At UCSD, we are committed to giving learners everywhere access to the quality, state-of-the-art data science training and preparation we provide our own Masters students in San Diego.  __We plan to work with other edX partner universities with appropriate Masters programs to encourage them to accept our MicroMasters courses for credit within their own programs.__  We'll update this page as we do this. These courses are designed directly from our own courses on campus and we believe they serve as an excellent foundation for many Masters programs preparing data scientists.

### Verified Learners

In addition to the benefits outlined above, verified learners will get more material(s) and engagement from the course team. For example, verified Learners of this course will get access to more questions on all graded assignments. Verified learners will also receive priority over audit learners in the discussion board.
