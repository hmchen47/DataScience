### MicroMasters in Data Science

To receive a MicroMasters Certificate in Data Science you must receive verified certificates in the following courses:

+ Python for Data Science
+ Probability and Statistics in Data Science using Python
+ Machine Learning Fundamentals
+ Big Data Analytics using Spark

Learners who receive their MicroMasters in Data Science Certificate are currently eligible to apply to the [Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University](https://tinyurl.com/yb2tbvmj) and [Masters in Data Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://tinyurl.com/yd4te5cg).  A MicroMasters in Data Science can be converted into a maximum of 100 units in this program as directed by the Curtin program course listing below.

+ MEDA5003 Multidisciplinary Data Visualization and Interpretation (25 credits)
+ STAT5001 Statistical Probability (12.5 credits)
+ STAT5006 Statistical Data Analysis 1 (12.5 credits)
+ ISYS5007 Data Management (25 credits)
+ Elective (25 credits)

However, we are committed to working with other edX University partners to find more programs where our courses help you complete their Masters programs.  As we add more programs where you can get credit, we will add them here and keep you updated.

To earn a certificate for this course, you must become a verified learner 10 days before the end date. If you purchase the program in bundle you receive a discount, but all courses must be completed in 15 months. 


### Verified Certificate Learners

Learners working toward a Verified Certificate may receive university course credit.  As such, there are a number of differences for those learners compared with those just wishing to audit the course.

Learners working toward a Verified Certificate will have access to:

+ A private learner forum so learners have opportunities to interact with the teaching staff.
+ Additional exercises to work through each week when learning the material.

Grading for learners working toward a Verified Certificate will be as follows:

1. Homework and comprehension quizzes will be automatically graded with feedback generated in real time.
2. The final exam will be proctored online.


#### HEY, WAIT!  THIS COURSE'S VERIFIED CERTIFICATE IS PRETTY EXPENSIVE!

It's true -- and you'll find that to be true for all courses in edX's MicroMasters programs.  Why is this?  Well, these courses are selected because they represent Masters level course content at UC San Diego and other edX University Partners.  __By completing our MicroMasters, not just a single course certificate, you indicate to employers and hiring personnel that you have made a significant investment in completing rigorous, Masters-level courses and content.__   So, MicroMasters courses should offer you more.

Also, if you decide you want to do a full Masters degree you can get one faster and less expensively!


#### UNIVERSITY COURSE CREDIT

edX's MicroMasters Credential program allows MOOC learners, like you, to get credit towards courses for a Masters degree on various university campuses (affiliated with edX).  

##### Current Masters Options

Currently, learners who successfully earn the MicroMasters Credential are eligible to apply for admission to the __Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University__.

If a learner applies for admission to the Master of Predictive Analytics program at Curtin University, and is accepted, the MicroMasters Credential will count towards 25% (or 100 credits of the 400 credits) of the coursework required for graduation in the Curtin program.

##### Future Masters Options

At UCSD, we are committed to giving learners everywhere access to the quality, state-of-the-art data science training and preparation we provide our own Masters students in San Diego.  __We plan to work with other edX partner universities with appropriate Masters programs to encourage them to accept our MicroMasters courses for credit within their own programs.__  We'll update this page as we do this. These courses are designed directly from our own courses on campus and we believe they serve as an excellent foundation for many Masters programs preparing data scientists.

#### Verified Learners

In addition to the benefits outlined above, verified learners will get more material(s) and engagement from the course team. For example, verified Learners of this course will get access to more questions on all graded assignments. Verified learners will also receive priority over audit learners in the discussion board.


### Tips for Succeeding in this Course

We really want you to succeed and finish this course!

To help with that, we have a lot of experience working with learners online and hope to share some of the best practices we've seen from the data and which have been reported back to us from learners. 

Here are some tips for you to help you complete the course:

Set aside time to work on the class.  We've all had the best intentions to start a new hobby, fitness regiment, or learn a new field.  One of the best ways to ensure you start, and stick, with the new practice is to set aside time for it on your calendar and hold yourself accountable to work at that time.

1. __Find friends or colleagues to work through the course with you.__  For our in-person classes, there is a lot of social accountability with being enrolled in a class.  Students attend class together and study together. While we know this isn't always possible for online learners, particularly those with already busy schedules, please explore this option if possible.

1. __Participate in the discussion forums.__  We have a number of discussion prompts during the class.  We encourage you to participate.  This helps you engage with the material in an active way and gain an increased sense of social belonging.
1. __Install the coding platform early.__  Learners often stumble at the first point in the course when coding is required.  So by the end of this week, be sure to follow our instructions on setting up Jupyter to run on your machine. This leads to....
1. __Play with the code.__  Throughout the course, we'll be walking through notebooks we've provided you.  Please work along with us and feel free to make changes, try out new ideas, and just generally play around with the code.
1. __Sign up for a certificate.__  It's easy -- just click here! This course is new, so we don't have data for it.  But for one of our other online courses, learners who sign up for the certificate are over 4x more likely to complete the course learners who do not.*  Also remember, this course is the first in our MicroMasters in Data Science.  We'll tell you more about it, but you can earn credit toward a real Masters degree!

\* Comparing learners who sign up for the certificate against learners who sign up to audit AND complete at least one graded assignment, certificate learners were over 4x more likely to finish the course.


## Syllabus

### Welcome to DSE210x

Welcome to Probability and Statistics In Data Science using Python!
We are delighted to welcome you to Probability and Statistics in Data Science using Python. In this course, you will learn the motivation, intuition, and theory behind the probabilistic and statistical foundations of data science, and will get to experiment and practice with these concepts via Python programs and the Jupyter Notebook platform.

#### Course Staff

Instructors

Alon Orlitsky, Professor, ECE and CSE Departments, UC San Diego
Yoav Freund, Professor, CSE Department, UC San Diego

Teaching Assistants

Mingchao Liang, Graduate Student, ECE, UC San Diego


### Prerequisites

The course is intended for learners with an undergraduate degree or senior undergraduates interested in broadening their understanding of probability and statistics. We will assume basic knowledge of the following topics

+ Logic (e.g., De Morgan’s Laws) 
+ Set theory (e.g., what are functions)
+ Calculus (e.g., calculating integrals and derivatives)
+ Programming (e.g., basic experience with any programming language)
+ Linear algebra (e.g., vectors and matrices)

The Python programming language will be used throughout the course. This can be obtained by taking the course DSE 200x, Python for Data Science.


### About this Course

This course will introduce more data science skills that prepare you for the next two courses in the MicroMasters: DSE220x-Machine Learning Fundamentals, and DSE230X-Big Data Analytics using Spark.


#### Overview

The course will cover the following topics:

+ Overview of sets
+ Counting principles
+ Combinatorics 
+ Discrete probability
+ Conditional probability and Bayes’ Rule
+ Random variables, expectation, variance, and correlation
+ Common distribution families
+ Continuous distributions
+ Probabilistic inequalities, concentration, and limit theorems
+ Regression
+ Sampling, parameter estimation, and confidence intervals
+ Hypothesis testing


#### Learning Objectives

The course will teach you how to visualize, understand, and reason about probabilistic and statistical concepts, and how to apply your knowledge to analyze data sets and draw meaningful conclusions from data. We will cover both theoretical and practical aspects, and will start each topic with motivation and intuition and will proceed with rigorous arguments and provable techniques. Each topic will be accompanied by a Python Notebook that you could run and modify to experiment with the material learned and get a better feel for the material covered. 


### Assessments

#### Python Notebooks

Each topic will be accompanied by a Python Jupyter Notebook with programs for visualizing, simulating, and exploring the material covered. You will be able to run the programs, modify the algorithms, and experiment with the simulations to get a better feel and understanding of the concepts covered.


#### Discussion forums

Two discussion forums, one for verified-learners and one for audit-learners, will let you to better understand the material by discussing it with fellow students and with course staff. While both forums will be monitored by our staff, the verified-learner forum will be more closely monitored and receive priority.

 
#### Assignments and Exams

To help you better understand the material and help us assess your progress, we will use three components. 

+ __Problem sets (35% of grade).__  Each lecture will be followed by a small problem set of roughly two math or calculation problems that test your understanding of the fundamental and practical implications of the material studied. There will be roughly 70 such problem sets, of which we will drop the worst 14 (roughly 20%). 
+ __Programming Assignments and Data Assignments (25% of grade).__  Each of the 13 topics will have a programming or data assignment in Python to help you develop your programming skills and ability to implement probabilistic concepts. You will need to run the program on your computer and enter your numerical answer on EdX. We will drop the worst 2 (20%) grades. 
+ __Final exam (40% of grade).__ The final exam will cover all course materials. It will consist of 10 problems similar in nature to those in the problem sets, and several problems may be taken or modified from the homework assignments. Due to testing challenges, programming problems will not be included in the final. A practice exam will be posted to prepare you for the type of questions asked. You can bring one standard sheet of paper (two sides, front and back) of handwritten or typed notes, three clean sheets of scratch paper, and a basic calculator, no other material will be allowed. You will have up to 4.5 hours to complete the exam. 

__Please see the official course syllabus under course handouts to read all the details about grading.__

NOTE: To receive a passing grade you must earn a (B) or better.

Verified Learners: If you feel that we made a mistake in grading, please first check the general discussion for Verified Learners to see if that problem has already been addressed.  If not, please explain your issue in the discussion forum and one of our teaching team will try to resolve your issue. If, after this, you still feel that your problem remains unresolved, please send an email to probstatpyth@gmail.com explaining your issue and we will either be able to solve your problem or direct your where to go to ensure that it is resolved. 

Please note: If the grading issue won't affect your overall grade, please refrain from requesting a regrade as there may be a large volume of learners making such requests.

### Course End Date and Verification Deadline

Although this class is self-paced, you must complete all work by August 11th, 2020, 18:00 UTC to earn a certificate. This instance of the course will close on August 11th, 2020, 18:00 UTC and we will open a new version of the course shortly thereafter. 

#### FAQ

I started the course late and I don't know if I can finish in time. Can I use my work and Verified Certificate for the next session?
Unfortunately, completed work and the Verified Certificate does not roll over per session, according to edX's policies. If you find that you cannot finish before the deadline (for the refund or switching to Verified), we suggest that you un-enroll your Verified status and re-enroll in the next session.
