# Statistics: Study Designs

## Overview

+ [Analytic study designs](../Notes/p02-Observational.md#introduction)
  + goal: to identify and evaluate causes or risk factors of diseases or health-related events
  + Types of observational studies
    + case-control and cohort studies
    + cross-section / prevalence studies
  + Temporal design of observational studies (right diagram)

+ [Evidence-based medicine](../Notes/p02-Observational.md#introduction) (EBM)
  + levels and qualifying studies
    + I: High-quality, multicenter or single-center, randomized controlled trial with adequate power; or systematic review of these studies
    + II: Lesser quality, randomized controlled trial; prospective cohort study; or systematic review of these studies
    + III: Retrospective comparative study; case-control study; or systematic review of these studies
    + IV: Case-series
    + V: Expert opinion; case report or clinical example; or evidence based on physiology, bench research, or “first principles”
  + randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology
  + observational studies
    + providing results similar to RCTs
    + challenging the belief
    + level II and III evidence in EBM
    + recent challenge: vulnerable to influenced by unpredictable confounding factors
    + complement RCTs in hypothesis generation, establishing questions for further RCTs, and defining clinical conditions


## Cohort Studies

+ [Definition of cohort](../Notes/p02-Observational.md#cohort-study)
  + epidemiology: cohort = a set of people followed over a period of time
  + modern epidemiological definition: a group of people w/ defined characteristics who are followed up to determine incidence of, or mortality from, some specific disease, all causes of death, or some other outcome
