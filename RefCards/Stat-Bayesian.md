# Bayesian Approaches

## Overview

+ Two competing philosophies of statistical analysis
  + the frequentist
  + the Bayesian

+ Bayesian methods
  + based on the idea of unknown quantities w/ probability distributions
  + unknown quantities including population means and proportions
  + prior knowledge / belief
    + the probability distribution proportion
    + the knowledge from data before knowing it



## Bayes Theorem



## Prior Distribution

+ [The prior distribution](../Notes/p01-Bayesian.md#31-subjectivity-and-context)
  + in Bayesian statistical inference, the probability distribution that would express one's beliefs about the quantity before some evidence is taken into account
  + methods to create prior
    + determined from past information, such as previous experiments
    + elicited from the purely subjective assessment of an experienced expert
    + (uninformative) created to reflect a balance among outcomes when no information is available
    + chosen according to some principle, such as symmetry or maximizing entropy given constraints
    + (conjugate) chosen a prior from a family simplifies calculation of the posterior distribution
