# Probability: Basics


## Basic Concepts

+ [Why should you care about prob&stat?](../Stats/ProbStatsPython/01-Intro.md#11-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics)
  + a powerful tool to deal w/ uncertainty
  + example: Navigation software
    + Certainty: find the _shortest_ route from a to b
    + Uncertainty: find the _fastest_ rout from a to b

+ [What is Probability Theory?](../Stats/ProbStatsPython/01-Intro.md#12-what-is-probability-theory)
  + Probability theory: a __mathematical__ framework for computing the probability of complex events
  + Assumption: __we know the probability of the basic events.__
  + relying on common sense at first
  + executing some experiments summing $k$ random numbers: $S_k = x_1, x_2 + \cdots + x_k$
  + experiments show that the sum $S_k$ is (almost) always in the range $[-4\sqrt{k}, 4\sqrt{k}]$

    \[\begin{align*}
      k \to \infty &\text{ s.t. }\frac{4\sqrt{k}}{k} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{k}} \to 0 \\
      \therefore\; k \to \infty &\text{ s.t. } \frac{S_k}{k} \to 0
    \end{align*}\]

+ [Math interpretation](../Stats/ProbStatsPython/01-Intro.md#12-what-is-probability-theory)
  + math involved in __proving__ (a precise version of) the statements above
  + in most cases, __approximating__ probabilities using simulations (Monte-Carlo simulations)
  + calculating the probabilities is better because
    + providing a precise answer
    + much faster than Monte-Carlo simulations
