# Statistics: Simulations

## Overview

+ [Computation and Bayesian approach](../Notes/p01-Bayesian.md#319-computational-issues)
  + full probability modeling
    + a.k.a. the Bayesian approach
    + applying probability theory to a model derived from substantive knowledge
    + able to deal w/ realistically complex situations
  + computational difficulties: <br/>w/ the specific problem being to carry out the integrations necessary to obtain the posterior distributions of quantities of interest in situations
    + non-standard prior distributions used
    + additional nuisance parameters in the model
  + solution: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
