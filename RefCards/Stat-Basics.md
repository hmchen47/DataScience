# Statistics: Basics

## Basic Concepts

+ Terminology
  + standard deviation ($sd$): a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values ($var = sd^2$) $\implies$ true population mean
  + standard error ($se$)
    + the standard deviation ($sd$) of its sampling distribution or an estimate of that standard deviation
    + not enough samples & different trials $\to$ different population means
  + sampling distribution: the probability distribution of a given random-sample-based statistic
  + frequency interpretation of probability: long-run properties of repeated random events
  + frequentist:
    + standard statistical methods
    + $p(x)$: the proportion of times $x$ will occur in an infinitely long series of repeated identical situations

+ odds ($O$):
  + the probability ($p$) that the event will occur divided by the probability ($1 - p$) that the event will not occur
  + used to describe the chance of an event occurring

  \[ O = \frac{p}{1 - p} \tag{Odds} \]

+ logit: the natural logarithm of the odds

  \[ \text{logit}(p) = \ln(\frac{p}{1 - p}) \tag{Odds.log} \]

+ Bayes theorem
  + Formula

  \[ p(b|a) = \frac{p(a|b)}{p(a)} \times p(b) \tag{Bayes} \]

  + The odds form of Bayes theorem

    \[ \frac{p(b|a)}{p(\overline{b}|a)} = \frac{p(a|b)}{p(a| \overline{b})} \times \frac{p(b)}{p(\overline{b})} \tag{Bayes.odds} \]
