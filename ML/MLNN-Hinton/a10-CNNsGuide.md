+ Convolutional neural networks
  + some of the most influential innovations in the field of computer vision
  + Alex Krizhevsky (2012) used them to win that yearâ€™s ImageNet competition
    + classification error: 26% to 15%
  + Company applications
    + Facebook: automatic tagging algorithms
    + Google: photo search
    + Amazon: product recommendations
    + Pinterest: home feed personalization
    + Instagram: search infrastructure


## The problem space

+ Image classification:
  + the task of taking an input image and outputting a class (a cat, dog, etc) or a probability of classes that best describes the image
  + humans: one of the first skills learned from the moment we are born and one that comes naturally and effortlessly as adults
    + able to immediately characterize the scene and give each object a label, all without even consciously noticing
    + able to quickly recognize patterns, generalize from prior knowledge, and adapt to different image environments


### Inputs and Outputs

+ Input
  + Image: an array of pixel values
  + resolution & size: e.g., 32 x 32 x 3 (RGB) array of numbers
  + intensity at a point: values from 0 to 255

+ Output: the probability of the image being a certain class
