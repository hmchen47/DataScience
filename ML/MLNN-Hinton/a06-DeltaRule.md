## Introduction

+ Delta Rule
  + a mathematically-derived (and thus potentially more flexible and powerful) rule for learning
  + a.k.a. Widrow & Hoff Learning rule or the Least Mean Square (LMS) rule
  + developed early 1960’s by Widrow and Hoff
  + similar to the perceptron learning rule by McClelland & Rumelhart, 1988.
  + using the difference between target activation (i.e., target output values) and obtained activation to drive learning
  + Linear Activation function: the output node’s activation is simply equal to the sum of the network’s respective input/weight products
