# Programming Assignment: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

## Multi-class Classification

+ Use logistic regression and neural networks to recognition handwitten digits (from 0 to 9).

+ Automated handwritten digit recognition

+ One-to-all classification


### Dataset

+ ex3data1.mat: 5000 training examples of handwritten digits
    + each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale of the digit
    + each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location

+ A 5000 by 400 matrix $X$ where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image

    $$X = \begin{bmatrix} - & (x^{(1)})^T & - \\ - & (x^{(2)})^T & - \\ & \vdots & \\ - & (x^{(m)})^T & - \end{bmatrix}$$

+ a 5000-dimensional vector $y$ that contains labels for the training set
