# Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression

[Program Assignment](https://s3.amazonaws.com/spark-public/ml/exercises/on-demand/machine-learning-ex1.zip)

## Simple Octave/MATLAB function

The first part of ex1.m gives you practice with Octave/MATLAB syntax and the homework submission process. In the le warmUpExercise.m, you will nd the outline of an Octave/MATLAB function. Modify it to return a 5 x 5 identity matrix by filling in the following code:

```matlab
A = eye(5);
```

After completing a part of the exercise, you can submit your solutions for grading by typing submit at the Octave/MATLAB command line.
