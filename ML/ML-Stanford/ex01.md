# Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression

[Program Assignment](https://s3.amazonaws.com/spark-public/ml/exercises/on-demand/machine-learning-ex1.zip)

## Simple Octave/MATLAB function

The first part of ex1.m gives you practice with Octave/MATLAB syntax and the homework submission process. In the le warmUpExercise.m, you will nd the outline of an Octave/MATLAB function. Modify it to return a 5 x 5 identity matrix by filling in the following code:

```matlab
A = eye(5);
```

After completing a part of the exercise, you can submit your solutions for grading by typing submit at the Octave/MATLAB command line.


## Linear regression with one variable

The file `ex1data1.txt` contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The rst column is the population of a city and the second column is the prot of a food truck in that city. A negative value for prot indicates a loss.

### Plotting the Data

In `ex1.m` the dataset is loaded from the data le into the variables $X$ and $y$:

```matlab
data = load('ex1data1.txt'); % read comma separated data
X = data(:, 1); y = data(:, 2);
m = length(y); % number of training examples
```

Next, the script calls the `plotData` function to create a scatter plot of the data. Your job is to complete `plotData.m` to draw the plot; modify the fille and fill in the following code:

```matlab
plot(x, y, 'rx', 'MarkerSize', 10); % Plot the data
ylabel('Profit in $10,000s'); % Set the y􀀀axis label
xlabel('Population of City in 10,000s'); % Set the x􀀀axis label
```
