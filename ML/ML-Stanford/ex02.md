# Programming Assignment: Logistic Regression

[Assignment](http://s3.amazonaws.com/spark-public/ml/exercises/on-demand/machine-learning-ex2.zip)

## Logistic Regression

+ build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
+ build a classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.

### Visualizing the data

+ load the data and display it on a 2-dimensional plot by calling the function `plotData`.

```matlab
% Find Indices of Positive and Negative Examples
pos = find(y==1); neg = find(y == 0);

% Plot Examples
plot(X(pos, 1), X(pos, 2), 'k+','LineWidth', 2, 'MarkerSize', 7);
plot(X(neg, 1), X(neg, 2), 'ko', 'MarkerFaceColor', 'y', 'MarkerSize', 7);
```


### Implementation

#### Warmup exercise: sigmoid function

+ logistic regression hypothesis

  $$h_\theta(x) = g(\theta^tx)$$

+ Sigmoid function: $g$

  $$g(z) = \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$}

+ testing w/ $z$ value
  + large positive ($z \rightarrow \infty$): $g(z) \approx 1$
  + large negative ($z \rightarrow -\infty$): $g(z) \approx 0$
  + $z = 0$: $g(z) = 1/2$

+ For a matrix, your function should perform the sigmoid function on every element.
