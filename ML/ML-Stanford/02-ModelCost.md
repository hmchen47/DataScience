#### ML:Linear Regression with One Variable

__Model Representation__

Recall that in _regression problems_, we are taking input variables and trying to fit the output onto a continuous expected result function.

Linear regression with one variable is also known as "univariate linear regression."

Univariate linear regression is used when you want to predict a __single output__ value y from a __single input__ value x. We're doing __supervised learning__ here, so that means we already have an idea about what the input/output cause and effect should be.

__The Hypothesis Function__

Our hypothesis function has the general form:

$$ \hat{y} = h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$$

Note that this is like the equation of a straight line. We give to $h_\theta(x)$ values for $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ to get our estimated output $\hat{y}$. In other words, we are trying to create a function called $h_\theta$ that is trying to map our input data (the x's) to our output data (the y's).

Example:

    Suppose we have the following set of training data:

<table style="text-align: center;"><tbody>
  <tr><th>input x</th><th>output y</th></tr>
  <tr><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>7</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


Now we can make a random guess about our $h_\theta$ function: $\theta_0=2$ and $\theta_1 = 2$. The hypothesis function becomes $h_\theta(x)=2+2x$.

So for input of 1 to our hypothesis, y will be 4. This is off by 3. Note that we will be trying out various values of $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ to try to find values which provide the best possible "fit" or the most representative "straight line" through the data points mapped on the x-y plane.


#### Cost Function

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's compared to the actual output y's.

$$J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left ( \hat{y}_{i}- y_{i} \right)^2 = \dfrac {1}{2m} \displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^m \left (h_\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i} \right)^2$$
 

To break it apart, it is $\frac{1}{2} \bar{x}$ where $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the squares of $h_\theta (x_{i}) - y_{i}$, or the difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

This function is otherwise called the "Squared error function", or "Mean squared error". The mean is halved $\left(\frac{1}{2m}\right)$ as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the $\frac{1}{2}$ term.

Now we are able to concretely measure the accuracy of our predictor function against the correct results we have so that we can predict new results we don't have.

If we try to think of it in visual terms, our training data set is scattered on the x-y plane. We are trying to make straight line (defined by $h_\theta(x)$) which passes through this scattered set of data. Our objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. In the best case, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set. In such a case the value of $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ will be 0.


#### ML:Gradient Descent

So we have our hypothesis function and we have a way of measuring how well it fits into the data. Now we need to estimate the parameters in hypothesis function. That's where gradient descent comes in.

Imagine that we graph our hypothesis function based on its fields $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ (actually we are graphing the cost function as a function of the parameter estimates). This can be kind of confusing; we are moving up to a higher level of abstraction. We are not graphing x and y itself, but the parameter range of our hypothesis function and the cost resulting from selecting particular set of parameters.

We put $\theta_0$ on the x axis and $\theta_1$  on the y axis, with the cost function on the vertical z axis. The points on our graph will be the result of the cost function using our hypothesis with those specific theta parameters.

We will know that we have succeeded when our cost function is at the very bottom of the pits in our graph, i.e. when its value is the minimum.

The way we do this is by taking the derivative (the tangential line to a function) of our cost function. The slope of the tangent is the derivative at that point and it will give us a direction to move towards. We make steps down the cost function in the direction with the steepest descent, and the size of each step is determined by the parameter Î±, which is called the learning rate.

The gradient descent algorithm is:

repeat until convergence:

$$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$$

where

$j=0,1$ represents the feature index number.

Intuitively, this could be thought of as:

repeat until convergence:

$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha$ [\text{Slope of tangent aka derivative in j dimension}]


__Gradient Descent for Linear Regression__

When specifically applied to the case of linear regression, a new form of the gradient descent equation can be derived. We can substitute our actual cost function and our actual hypothesis function and modify the equation to (the derivation of the formulas are out of the scope of this course, but a really great one can be found here):

repeat until convergence: 

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
    \theta_0 & := & \theta_0 - \alpha \dfrac{1}{m} \displaystyle \sum^{m}_{i=0} (h_\theta (x_i) - y_i) \\ \\
    \theta_1 & := & \theta_1 - \alpha \dfrac{1}{m} \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^m ((h_\theta (x_i) - y_i) x_i)
\end{array}$$

where $m$ is the size of the training set, $\theta_0$ a constant that will be changing simultaneously with $\theta_1$ and $x_{i}$, $y_{i}$, are values of the given training set (data).

Note that we have separated out the two cases for $\theta_j$ into separate equations for $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$; and that for $\theta_1$ we are multiplying $x_{i}$ at the end due to the derivative.

The point of all this is that if we start with a guess for our hypothesis and then repeatedly apply these gradient descent equations, our hypothesis will become more and more accurate.

### Errata

#### Linear Regression With One Variable

+ A general note about the graphs that Prof Ng sketches when discussing the cost function. The vertical axis can be labeled either 'y' or 'h(x)' interchangeably. 'y' is the true value of the training example, and is indicated with a marker. 'h(x)' is the hypothesis, and is typically drawn as a curve. The scale of the vertical axis is the same, so both can be plotted on the same axis.
+ In the video "Cost Function - Intuition I", at about 6:34, the value given for J(0.5) is incorrect.
+ Parameter Learning: Video "Gradient Descent for Linear Regression": At 6:15, the equation Prof Ng writes in blue "h(x) = -900 - 0.1x" is incorrect, it should use "+900".


#### Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

+ At Timestamp 3:27 of this video lecture, the equation for Î¸1 is wrong, please refer to first line of Page 6 of ex1.pdf (Week 2 programming Assignment) for model equation (The last x is X superscript i, subscript j (Which is 1 in this case, as it is of Î¸1)). Î¸0 is correct as it will be multiplied by 1 anyways(value of X superscript i, subscript 0 is 1), as per the model equation.
