## Machine Learning Honor Code

### Machine Learning Honor Code

We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students.


### Guidelines for Posting Code in Discussion Forums

+ Scenario 1: Code to delete

    _Learner Question/Comment: "Here is the code I have so far, but it fails the grader. Please help me fix it."_

    __Why Delete?__: The reason is that if there is a simple fix provided by a student, a quick copy and paste with a small edit will provide credit without individual effort.

    _Learner Question: A student substitutes words for the math operators, but includes the variable names (or substitutes the equivalent greek letters (θ for 'theta', etc). This student also provides a sentence-by-sentence, line by line, description of exactly what their code implements. "The first line of my script has the equation "hypothesis equals theta times X", but I get the following error message..."._

    __Why Delete?__: This should be deleted. “Spelling out” the code in English is the same as using the regular code.

+ Scenario 2: Code not to delete

    Learner Question: How do I subset a matrix to eliminate the intercept?

    Mentor Response: This probably would be okay, especially if the person posting makes an effort to not use familiar variable names, or to use a context which has nothing to do with the contexts in the assignments.

    It is clearly ok to show examples of Octave code to demonstrate a technique. Even if the technique itself is directly applicable to a programming problem at hand. As long as what is typed cannot be "cut and pasted" into the program at hand.

    E.g. how do I set column 1 of a matrix to zero? Try this in your Octave work area:

    ```matlab
    >> A = magic(3)

    >> A(:,1) = 0
    ```

    The above is always acceptable (in my understanding). Demonstrating techniques and learning the language/syntax are important Forum activities.

## How to Use Discussion Forums

When you enter the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions?sort=lastActivityAtDesc&page=1) for your course, you will see an Upvote button under each post. We encourage you to upvote posts you find thoughtful, interesting, or helpful. This is the best way to ensure that quality posts will be seen by other learners in the course. Upvoting will also increase the likelihood that important questions get addressed and answered.

### Report Abuse

Coursera's Code of Conduct prohibits:

+ Bullying or threatening other users
+ Posting spam or promotional content
+ Posting mature content
+ Posting assignment solutions (or other violations of the [Honor Code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/nh65Z/machine-learning-honor-code))

Please report any posts that infringe upon copyright or are abusive, offensive, or that otherwise violate [Coursera’s Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) by using the Report this option found under the menu arrow to the right of each post.


### Following

If you find a particular thread interesting, click the __Follow__ button under the original post of that thread page. When you follow a post, you will receive an email notification anytime a new post is made.

### Improving Your Posts

Course discussion forums are your chance to interact with thousands of like-minded individuals around the world. Getting their attention is one way to do well in this course. In any social interaction, certain rules of etiquette are expected and contribute to more enjoyable and productive communication. The following are tips for interacting in this course via the forums, adapted from guidelines originally compiled by AHA! and Chuq Von Rospach & Gene Spafford:

1. Stay on topic in existing forums and threads. Off-topic posts make it hard for other learners to find information they need. Post in the most appropriate forum for your topic, and do not post the same thing in multiple forums.
2. Use the filters at the top of the forum page (Latest, Top, and Unanswered) to find active, interesting content.
3. Upvote posts that are helpful and interesting.
4. Be civil. If you disagree, explain your position with respect and refrain from any and all personal attacks.
5. Stay on topic. In particular, don’t change the subject in the middle of an existing thread – just start a new topic.
6. Make sure you’re understood, even by non-native English speakers. Try to write full sentences, and avoid text-message abbreviations or slang. Be careful when you use humor and sarcasm as these messages are easy to misinterpret.
7. If asking a question, provide as much information as possible, what you’ve already considered, what you’ve already read, etc.
8. Cite appropriate references when using someone else’s ideas, thoughts, or words.
9. Do not use a forum to promote your product, service, or business.
10. Conclude posts by inviting other learners to extend the discussion. For example, you could say “I would love to understand what others think.”
11. Do not post personal information about other posters in the forum.
12. Report spammers.

For more details, refer to [Coursera's Forum Code of Conduct](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280036-Coursera-Code-of-Conduct).

These tips and tools for interacting in this course via the forums were adapted from guidelines originally by The University of Illinois.

This post contains links to all of the programming exercise tutorials.

After clicking on a link, you may need to scroll down to find the highlighted post.

--- Note: Additional test cases can be found ([here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/0SxufTSrEeWPACIACw4G5w)) ---

---------------------

#### ex1

[computeCost()](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/t35D1xn3EeWA7CIAC5WDNQ) tutorial - also applies to computeCostMulti().

[gradientDescent()](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/-m2ng_KQEeSUBCIAC9QURQ) - also applies to gradientDescentMulti() - includes test cases.

[featureNormalize()](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/module/vW94N/discussions/c7VBzJ9lEeWILRIOm1V0SQ) tutorial

Note: if you use OS X and the contour plot doesn't display correctly, see the "Resources Menu" page "Tips on Octave OS X" for how to fix it.

------------------------

#### ex2

Note: If you are using MATLAB version R2015a or later, the fminunc() function has been changed in this version. The function works better, but does not give the expected result for Figure 5 in ex2.pdf, and it throws some warning messages (about a local minimum) when you run ex2_reg.m. This is normal, and you should still be able to submit your work to the grader.

Note: If your installation has trouble with the GradObj option, see this thread: [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/s6tSSB9CEeWd3iIAC7VAtA)

Note: If you are using a linux-derived operating system, you may need to remove the attribute "MarkerFaceColor" from the plot() function call in plotData.m.

Note: if your images are upside-down, use flipud() to reverse the data. This is due to a change in gnuplot()'s defaults.

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Tips on lrCostFunction():<p>

+ When completed, this function is identical to your costFunctionReg() from ex2, but using vectorized methods. See the ex2 tutorials for the cost and gradient - they use vectorized methods.
+ ex3.pdf tells you to first implement the unregularized parts, then to implement the regularized parts. Then you test your code, and then submit it for grading.
+ Do not remove the line "grad = grad(:)" from the end of the lrCostFunction.m script template. This line guarantees that the grad value is returned as a column vector.

### Tips on Octave OS X

Try installing a later version of Octave than the one recommended on the course content (3.8.0).

http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X. Under "Installing a Mac OS X Bundle," you can click on "download Octave 4.0.3 with Graphical User Interface."

Error message "unknown or ambiguous terminal type"
A) Try changing the terminal type with this command, for any of "qt", "x11", or "aqua":

```bash
setenv("GNUTERM","qt")
```

Alternatively you can install the AquaTerm backend from SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/aquaterm/

and then reinstalling GNUplot with Aqua terminal support:

```bash
brew uninstall gnuplot
brew install gnuplot ----with-aquaterm
```

B) You may also try this:

```bash
brew uninstall fontconfig
brew install fontconfig --universal
brew uninstall gnuplot
brew install gnuplot --with-qt
```

... then add this to ~/.octaverc

```bash
setenv("GNUTERM","qt")
```


#### The hist() or plot () function hangs

It's not really hung - on some distributions of Octave, the first plotting function you call causes the font library to generated. This can take a minute or so the first time, then after that the plotting functions will work much faster.

Alternatively if Octave still does not respond after some time, you may have to change your fontconfig. I also installed gnuplot with-x11 and changed the file octaverc. These are the terminal commands:

```bash
brew install fltk
brew install gnuplot --with-x11
brew uninstall fontconfig
brew install fontconfig --universal

then edit /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc , put this in the file
```

-------- (start copy) --------

```bash
setenv ("GNUTERM", "X11")
gnuplot_binary("/usr/local/bin/gnuplot")
graphics_toolkit('gnuplot')
```

-------- (end copy) --------

save the file and start octave

verify by running:

```bash
available_graphics_toolkits       % this will show the available graphics toolkits that can be loaded
loaded_graphics_toolkits          % this will show the graphics toolkit that is currently loaded
```

other useful command examples:

```bash
register_graphics_toolkit("fltk") % this will add the fltk graphics toolkit to the available graphics toolkits list
graphics_toolkit("qt")            % this will load the qt graphics toolkit
```

Errors when editing ex1 "plotData.m"

If you get an error like:

```bash
: invalid character '�' (ASCII 226) near line 14, column 14
```

Then try to uncheck the TextEdit Preference - Smart quotes and Smart dashes; then use double quotes(") instead of single quotes(')

#### Try Using Vagrant and Virtualbox

If you are using OS X (and some brands of Linux), you can have a lot of trouble getting the visualizations to work natively. One solution is to turn to virtualization; you can find a vagrant file that gets an ubuntu machine configured in virtual box, along with scripts to make this feel like a native OS X app [here](http://deepneural.blogspot.fr/p/welcome.html). Another script can be found here, but this one is just the Vagrant file and does not have all the nice [OS X scripts bundled](https://gist.github.com/Starefossen/9353638) with it.

You'll additionally need [virtualbox and vagrant](https://www.virtualbox.orghttps://www.vagrantup.com) to go down this route, which are thankfully both free.

You'll need an X server, which you almost certainly are using in Linux already, but does not come out of the box with OS X. OS X users can get it [here](http://www.xquartz.org).



## Who are Mentors?

Mentor Program Overview:

Community Mentors are successful, dedicated Coursera learners who volunteer to assist with support and discussion forum moderation in courses that they have already completed. They have been recruited by Coursera to encourage newer learners, answer questions, set an example by posting thoughtful and timely content, and report platform bugs and inappropriate content to Coursera.

As you use the [discussion areas](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions), please be aware that the ideas expressed by participants in this course, including the Mentors, do not represent the views of Stanford University. The mentors are not employed by Stanford University and they have not been vetted by Stanford University as experts on course content or course facilitation.
