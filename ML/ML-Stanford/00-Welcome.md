## Machine Learning Honor Code

### Machine Learning Honor Code

We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students.


### Guidelines for Posting Code in Discussion Forums

+ Scenario 1: Code to delete

    _Learner Question/Comment: "Here is the code I have so far, but it fails the grader. Please help me fix it."_

    __Why Delete?__: The reason is that if there is a simple fix provided by a student, a quick copy and paste with a small edit will provide credit without individual effort.

    _Learner Question: A student substitutes words for the math operators, but includes the variable names (or substitutes the equivalent greek letters (θ for 'theta', etc). This student also provides a sentence-by-sentence, line by line, description of exactly what their code implements. "The first line of my script has the equation "hypothesis equals theta times X", but I get the following error message..."._

    __Why Delete?__: This should be deleted. “Spelling out” the code in English is the same as using the regular code.

+ Scenario 2: Code not to delete

    Learner Question: How do I subset a matrix to eliminate the intercept?

    Mentor Response: This probably would be okay, especially if the person posting makes an effort to not use familiar variable names, or to use a context which has nothing to do with the contexts in the assignments.

    It is clearly ok to show examples of Octave code to demonstrate a technique. Even if the technique itself is directly applicable to a programming problem at hand. As long as what is typed cannot be "cut and pasted" into the program at hand.

    E.g. how do I set column 1 of a matrix to zero? Try this in your Octave work area:

    ```matlab
    >> A = magic(3)

    >> A(:,1) = 0
    ```

    The above is always acceptable (in my understanding). Demonstrating techniques and learning the language/syntax are important Forum activities.

## How to Use Discussion Forums

When you enter the [discussion forum](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions?sort=lastActivityAtDesc&page=1) for your course, you will see an Upvote button under each post. We encourage you to upvote posts you find thoughtful, interesting, or helpful. This is the best way to ensure that quality posts will be seen by other learners in the course. Upvoting will also increase the likelihood that important questions get addressed and answered.

### Report Abuse

Coursera's Code of Conduct prohibits:

+ Bullying or threatening other users
+ Posting spam or promotional content
+ Posting mature content
+ Posting assignment solutions (or other violations of the [Honor Code](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/nh65Z/machine-learning-honor-code))

Please report any posts that infringe upon copyright or are abusive, offensive, or that otherwise violate [Coursera’s Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code) by using the Report this option found under the menu arrow to the right of each post.


### Following

If you find a particular thread interesting, click the __Follow__ button under the original post of that thread page. When you follow a post, you will receive an email notification anytime a new post is made.

### Improving Your Posts

Course discussion forums are your chance to interact with thousands of like-minded individuals around the world. Getting their attention is one way to do well in this course. In any social interaction, certain rules of etiquette are expected and contribute to more enjoyable and productive communication. The following are tips for interacting in this course via the forums, adapted from guidelines originally compiled by AHA! and Chuq Von Rospach & Gene Spafford:

1. Stay on topic in existing forums and threads. Off-topic posts make it hard for other learners to find information they need. Post in the most appropriate forum for your topic, and do not post the same thing in multiple forums.
2. Use the filters at the top of the forum page (Latest, Top, and Unanswered) to find active, interesting content.
3. Upvote posts that are helpful and interesting.
4. Be civil. If you disagree, explain your position with respect and refrain from any and all personal attacks.
5. Stay on topic. In particular, don’t change the subject in the middle of an existing thread – just start a new topic.
6. Make sure you’re understood, even by non-native English speakers. Try to write full sentences, and avoid text-message abbreviations or slang. Be careful when you use humor and sarcasm as these messages are easy to misinterpret.
7. If asking a question, provide as much information as possible, what you’ve already considered, what you’ve already read, etc.
8. Cite appropriate references when using someone else’s ideas, thoughts, or words.
9. Do not use a forum to promote your product, service, or business.
10. Conclude posts by inviting other learners to extend the discussion. For example, you could say “I would love to understand what others think.”
11. Do not post personal information about other posters in the forum.
12. Report spammers.

For more details, refer to [Coursera's Forum Code of Conduct](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/208280036-Coursera-Code-of-Conduct).

These tips and tools for interacting in this course via the forums were adapted from guidelines originally by The University of Illinois.

This post contains links to all of the programming exercise tutorials.

After clicking on a link, you may need to scroll down to find the highlighted post.

--- Note: Additional test cases can be found ([here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/0SxufTSrEeWPACIACw4G5w)) ---

---------------------

#### ex1

[computeCost()](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/t35D1xn3EeWA7CIAC5WDNQ) tutorial - also applies to computeCostMulti().

[gradientDescent()](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/-m2ng_KQEeSUBCIAC9QURQ) - also applies to gradientDescentMulti() - includes test cases.

[featureNormalize()](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/module/vW94N/discussions/c7VBzJ9lEeWILRIOm1V0SQ) tutorial

Note: if you use OS X and the contour plot doesn't display correctly, see the "Resources Menu" page "Tips on Octave OS X" for how to fix it.

------------------------

#### ex2

Note: If you are using MATLAB version R2015a or later, the fminunc() function has been changed in this version. The function works better, but does not give the expected result for Figure 5 in ex2.pdf, and it throws some warning messages (about a local minimum) when you run ex2_reg.m. This is normal, and you should still be able to submit your work to the grader.

Note: If your installation has trouble with the GradObj option, see this thread: [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/s6tSSB9CEeWd3iIAC7VAtA)

Note: If you are using a linux-derived operating system, you may need to remove the attribute "MarkerFaceColor" from the plot() function call in plotData.m.

Note: if your images are upside-down, use flipud() to reverse the data. This is due to a change in gnuplot()'s defaults.

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Tips on lrCostFunction():<p>

+ When completed, this function is identical to your costFunctionReg() from ex2, but using vectorized methods. See the ex2 tutorials for the cost and gradient - they use vectorized methods.
+ ex3.pdf tells you to first implement the unregularized parts, then to implement the regularized parts. Then you test your code, and then submit it for grading.
+ Do not remove the line "grad = grad(:)" from the end of the lrCostFunction.m script template. This line guarantees that the grad value is returned as a column vector.

### Tips on Octave OS X

Try installing a later version of Octave than the one recommended on the course content (3.8.0).

http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X. Under "Installing a Mac OS X Bundle," you can click on "download Octave 4.0.3 with Graphical User Interface."

Error message "unknown or ambiguous terminal type"
A) Try changing the terminal type with this command, for any of "qt", "x11", or "aqua":

```bash
setenv("GNUTERM","qt")
```

Alternatively you can install the AquaTerm backend from SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/aquaterm/

and then reinstalling GNUplot with Aqua terminal support:

```bash
brew uninstall gnuplot
brew install gnuplot ----with-aquaterm
```

B) You may also try this:

```bash
brew uninstall fontconfig
brew install fontconfig --universal
brew uninstall gnuplot
brew install gnuplot --with-qt
```

... then add this to ~/.octaverc

```bash
setenv("GNUTERM","qt")
```


#### The hist() or plot () function hangs

It's not really hung - on some distributions of Octave, the first plotting function you call causes the font library to generated. This can take a minute or so the first time, then after that the plotting functions will work much faster.

Alternatively if Octave still does not respond after some time, you may have to change your fontconfig. I also installed gnuplot with-x11 and changed the file octaverc. These are the terminal commands:

```bash
brew install fltk
brew install gnuplot --with-x11
brew uninstall fontconfig
brew install fontconfig --universal

then edit /usr/local/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc , put this in the file
```

-------- (start copy) --------

```bash
setenv ("GNUTERM", "X11")
gnuplot_binary("/usr/local/bin/gnuplot")
graphics_toolkit('gnuplot')
```

-------- (end copy) --------

save the file and start octave

verify by running:

```bash
available_graphics_toolkits       % this will show the available graphics toolkits that can be loaded
loaded_graphics_toolkits          % this will show the graphics toolkit that is currently loaded
```

other useful command examples:

```bash
register_graphics_toolkit("fltk") % this will add the fltk graphics toolkit to the available graphics toolkits list
graphics_toolkit("qt")            % this will load the qt graphics toolkit
```

Errors when editing ex1 "plotData.m"

If you get an error like:

```bash
: invalid character '�' (ASCII 226) near line 14, column 14
```

Then try to uncheck the TextEdit Preference - Smart quotes and Smart dashes; then use double quotes(") instead of single quotes(')

#### Try Using Vagrant and Virtualbox

If you are using OS X (and some brands of Linux), you can have a lot of trouble getting the visualizations to work natively. One solution is to turn to virtualization; you can find a vagrant file that gets an ubuntu machine configured in virtual box, along with scripts to make this feel like a native OS X app [here](http://deepneural.blogspot.fr/p/welcome.html). Another script can be found here, but this one is just the Vagrant file and does not have all the nice [OS X scripts bundled](https://gist.github.com/Starefossen/9353638) with it.

You'll additionally need [virtualbox and vagrant](https://www.virtualbox.orghttps://www.vagrantup.com) to go down this route, which are thankfully both free.

You'll need an X server, which you almost certainly are using in Linux already, but does not come out of the box with OS X. OS X users can get it [here](http://www.xquartz.org).



## Who are Mentors?

Mentor Program Overview:

Community Mentors are successful, dedicated Coursera learners who volunteer to assist with support and discussion forum moderation in courses that they have already completed. They have been recruited by Coursera to encourage newer learners, answer questions, set an example by posting thoughtful and timely content, and report platform bugs and inappropriate content to Coursera.

As you use the [discussion areas](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions), please be aware that the ideas expressed by participants in this course, including the Mentors, do not represent the views of Stanford University.

## Frequently Asked Questions

The following Machine Learning Mentors volunteered time to compile this list of Frequently Asked Questions: Colin Beckingham, Kevin Burnham, Maxim Haytovich, Tom Mosher, Richard Gayle, Simon Crase, Michael Reardon and Paul Mielke.

Be sure to thank them when you see them in the discussion forums!

### General Questions

__Q: Is the grader server down?__ A: First step is to check [here](http://status.coursera.org/).

__Q: The audio in the videos is quite bad sometimes, muffled or low volume. Please fix it.__ A: You can mitigate the audio issues by turning down the bass and up the treble if you have those controls, or using a headset, which naturally emphasizes the higher frequencies. Also you may want to switch on the English closed captioning. It is unlikely to be fixed in the near term because most students do not have serious problems and therefore it is low on the priority list.

__Q: What does it mean when I see “Math Processing Error?”__ A: The page is attempting to use MathJax to render math symbols. Sometimes the content delivery network can be sluggish or you have caught the web page Ajax javascript code in an incomplete state. Normally just refreshing the page to make it load fully fixes the problem

__Q: How can I download lectures?__ A: On Demand videos cannot be downloaded.

__Q: Is there a prerequisite for this course?__ A: Students are expected to have the following background:

  + Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program.
  + Familiarity with the basic probability theory.
  + Familiarity with the basic linear algebra.

__Q: Why do we have to use Matlab or Octave? Why not Clojure, Julia, Python, R or [Insert favourite language here]?__ A: As Prof. Ng explained in the 1st video of the Octave tutorial, he has tried teaching Machine Learning in a variety of languages, and found that students come up to speed faster with Matlab/Octave. Therefore the course was designed using Octave/Matlab, and the automatic submission grader uses those program interfaces. Octave and Matlab are optimized for rapid vectorized calculations, which is very useful in Machine Learning. R is a nice tool, but:

1. It is a bit too high level. This course shows how to actually implement the algorithms of machine learning, while R already has them implemented. Since the focus of this course is to show you what happens in ML algorithms under the hood, you need to use Octave.
2. This course offers some starter code in Octave/Matlab, which will really save you tons of time solving the tasks.

__Q: Has anyone figured out the how to solve this problem? Here is my code [Insert code].__ A: This is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. Find the Honor Code [here](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).

__Q: I've submitted correct answers for [insert problem]. However I would like to compare my implementation with other who did correctly.__ A: This is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. Find the Honor Code [here](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).

__Q: This is my email: [insert email]. Can we get the answer for the quiz?__ A: This is a violation of the Coursera Honor Code. Find the Honor Code [here](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code).

__Q: Do I receive a certificate once I complete this course?__ A: Course Certificate is available in this course. Click [here](https://www.coursera.org/certificate/machine-learning) to learn about how Course Certificate works and how to purchase.

__Q: Why do all the answers in a multiple correct question say correct response when you submit the answer to an in-video question?__ A: Coursera's software is designed to suggest the correctness of each state of the check box. Therefore, an answer having a correct answer tag below it means that the state of that check box is correct.

__Q: What is the correct technique of entering a numeric answer to a text box question?__ A: Coursera's software for numeric answers only supports '.' as the decimal delimiter (not ',') and require that fractions be simplified to decimals. For answers with many decimal digits, please use a 2 digits after decimal point rounding method when entering solutions if not mentioned in the question.

__Q: What is the correct technique of entering a 1 element matrix?__ A: They should be entered as just the element without brackets.

__Q: What does a A being a 3 element vector or a 3 dimensional vector mean?__ A: If not described a vector as mentioned in the questions is 

$$A = \left[ \begin{array}{c} element1 \\ element2 \\ element3 \end{array} \right]$$

__Q: I think I found an error in a video. What should I do__? A: First, check the errata section under resources menu. If you are unsure if it is an error, create a new thread in the discussion forum describing the error.

__Q: My quiz grade displayed is wrong or I have a verification issue or I cannot retake a quiz. What should I do?__ A: Contact Help Center. These queries can only be resolved by learner support and it is best if they are contacted directly.

## Programming Environment - Environment Setup Instructions

### Setting Up Your Programming Assignment Environment

The Machine Learning course includes several programming assignments which you’ll need to finish to complete the course. The assignments require the Octave or MATLAB scientific computing languages.

+ Octave is a free, open-source application available for many platforms. It has a text interface and an experimental graphical one.
+ MATLAB is proprietary software, but a free trial license to MATLAB Online is being offered for the completion of this course.

#### FAQ

__Does it cost money?__

While you’re taking the course, both software packages are available free of charge. Octave is distributed under the GNU Public License, which means that it is always free to download and distribute. MATLAB Online licenses are available for completing the programming assignments in the course only. For any other purposes (like your own work after you complete the course), MATLAB can be licensed to [individuals](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-home.html) or companies from Mathworks directly.

__Is there a difference in quality?__

There are several subtle differences between the two software packages. MATLAB may offer a smoother experience (especially for Mac users), contains a larger number of functions, and can be more robust to failure. However, the functions used in this course are available in both packages, and many students have successfully completed the course using either.

__How do I install one of them?__

See installation instructions for [Windows](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/p9ckf/installing-octave-matlab-on-windows), [Mac OS X (10.10 Yosemite and 10.9 Mavericks)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/ykU6M/installing-octave-matlab-on-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-and-10-9-mavericks), [other Mac OS X](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/M16Qr/installing-octave-matlab-on-mac-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion-and-earlier), or [GNU/Linux](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/NSG5j/installing-octave-matlab-on-gnu-linux).


### Access MATLAB Online and Upload the Exercise Files

Access to MATLAB Online is being provided by MathWorks to Machine Learning students for the duration of the course. MATLAB Online is the online version of the MATLAB desktop program.

Your MathWorks account comes with free cloud storage via [MATLAB Drive](https://drive.matlab.com/) which you can access in MATLAB Online. To add the programming exercise files to MATLAB Online, download them files as a zip file to your desktop using the link below, then rename the file to: __machine-learning-ex__ (Coursera adds extra characters to the filename upon download that must be removed)

```
machine-learning-ex.zip
```

To add the exercise files to MATLAB Online,

1. Open MATLAB Online and click the 'Upload' button in the 'Home' tab.
2. Use the folder window that opens to find and select the 'machine-learning-ex.zip' file, then click 'Open'. You should see the file in MATLAB Online after upload is complete.
3. Unzip the file by entering the command: `unzip machine-learning-ex.zip` at the command line.

Note that you can access your files even after your MATLAB Online license expires through MATLAB Drive.


#### Completing the programming exercises in MATLAB Online

There are eight programming exercises in the course, the first is posted at the end of Week 2. When you reach a programming exercise page in the course, you do not need to download the exercise zip file, as the necessary files for all exercises are included in the zip folder above. __Make note of your assignment token, however, you will need it to submit your solutions__.

__IMPORTANT__: The exercise files above been updated specifically for MATLAB Online users. Instructions for completing the exercises in MATLAB Online and tips for troubleshooting problems are found in the included __README.mlx__ file. Before attempting your first programming exercise, read all of the instructions in __README.mlx__. Note that the instructions for MATLAB Online users differ from the instructions and video demonstration provided later in the course which only apply to Octave and MATLAB Desktop users.


### Installing Octave on Windows

Use this link to install [Octave for windows](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Microsoft_Windows)

Octave on Windows can be used to submit programming assignments in this course but will likely need a patch provided in the discussion forum. Refer to [Sumitting your work](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions/vgCyrQoMEeWv5yIAC00Eog?) for more information about the patch for your version.

"__Warning__: Do not install Octave 4.0.0"; checkout the "Resources" menu's section of "Installation Issues".


### Installing Octave on Mac OS X (10.10 Yosemite and 10.9 Mavericks and Later)

1. Mac OS X has a feature called Gatekeeper that may only let you install applications from the Mac App Store. You may need to configure it to allow the Octave installer. Visit your System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, and check the setting to allow apps downloaded from Anywhere. You may need to enter your password to unlock the settings page.
    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/supplement/ykU6M/installing-octave-on-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-and-10-9-mavericks-and-later"> <br/>

    </a>

2. Download [the Octave 3.8.0 installer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20MacOSX%20Binary/2013-12-30%20binary%20installer%20of%20Octave%203.8.0%20for%20OSX%2010.9.1%20%28beta%29/GNU_Octave_3.8.0-6.dmg/download) or the latest version that isn't 4.0.0. The file is large so this may take some time.

3. Open the downloaded image, probably named GNU_Octave_3.8.0-6.dmg on your computer, and then open Octave-3.8.0-6.mpkg inside.

4. Follow the installer’s instructions. You may need to enter the administrator password for your computer.

5. After the installer completes, Octave should be installed on your computer. You can find Octave-cli in your Mac’s Applications, which is a text interface for Octave that you can use to complete Machine Learning’s programming assignments.

Octave also includes an experimental graphical interface which is called Octave-gui, also in your Mac’s Applications, but we recommend using Octave-cli because it’s more stable.

Note: If you use a package manager (like MacPorts or Homebrew), we recommend you follow [the package manager installation instructions](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X#Package_Managers).
