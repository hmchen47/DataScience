### Error in `ex8_cofi.m`


There is an error in the `ex8_cofi.m` script. In Part 7, around line 200, the code that calls `fmincg()` and `cofiCostFunc()` should use the Ynorm variable, instead of Y.

Figure 4 in `ex8.pdf` is also incorrect - no movies should have ratings higher than 5.

This issue is also documented in the Errata lists in the Resources menu.
