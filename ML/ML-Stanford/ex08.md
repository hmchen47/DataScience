### Error in `ex8_cofi.m`


There is an error in the `ex8_cofi.m` script. In Part 7, around line 200, the code that calls `fmincg()` and `cofiCostFunc()` should use the Ynorm variable, instead of Y.

Figure 4 in `ex8.pdf` is also incorrect - no movies should have ratings higher than 5.

This issue is also documented in the Errata lists in the Resources menu.


### ex8 tutorial for `cofiCostFunc()`

Vectorized tutorial for cost and gradients with regularization

+ Definitions:
    + $R$: a matrix of observations (binary values). Dimensions are (movies x users)
    + $Y$: a matrix of movie ratings: Dimensions are (movies x users)
    + $X$: a matrix of movie features (0 to 5): Dimensions are (movies x features)
    + $Theta$: a matrix of feature weights: Dimensions are (users x features)

+ Compute the predicted movie ratings for all users using the product of $X$ and $Theta$. A transposition may be needed. Dimensions of the result should be (movies x users).
+ Compute the movie rating error by subtracting Y from the predicted ratings.
+ Compute the "error_factor" my multiplying the movie rating error by the R matrix. The error factor will be 0 for movies that a user has not rated. Use the type of multiplication by R (vector or element-wise) so the size of the error factor matrix remains unchanged (movies x users).

(Note: there is a quirk in the submit grader's test case that requires you to use the R matrix to ignore movies that have had no ratings).

#### Calculate the cost:

+ Using the formula on Page 9 of ex8.pdf, compute the unregularized cost as a scaled sum of the squares of all of the terms in error_factor. The result should be a scalar.
+ Test your code using ex8_cofi.m and the additional test cases. You should get a passing grade for this portion from the submit script.

#### Calculate the gradients (ref: the formulas on Page 10 of ex8,pdf):

+ The $X$ gradient is the product of the error factor and the Theta matrix. The sum is computed automatically by the vector multiplication. Dimensions are (movies x features)
+ The $Theta$ gradient is the product of the error factor and the X matrix. A transposition may be needed. The sum is computed automatically by the vector multiplication. Dimensions are (users x features)
+  Test your code, then submit this portion.

#### Calculate the regularized cost:

+ Using the formula on the top of Page 13 of ex8.pdf, compute the regularization term as the scaled sum of the squares of all terms in Theta and X. The result should be a scalar. Note that for Recommender Systems there are no bias terms, so regularization should include all columns of X and Theta.
+ Add the regularized and un-regularized cost terms.
+ Test your code, then submit this portion.

#### Calculate the gradient regularization terms (ref: the formulas in the middle of Page 13 of ex8.pdf)

+ The X gradient regularization is the X matrix scaled by lambda.
+ The Theta gradient regularization is the Theta matrix scaled by lambda.
+ Add the regularization terms to their unregularized values.
+ Test your code, then submit this portion.


### Programming Exercise 8

#### Debugging Tip

The submit script, for all the programming assignments, does not report the line number and location of the error when it crashes. The follow method can be used to make it do so which makes debugging easier.

Open ex8/lib/submitWithConfiguration.m and replace line:

```matlab
 fprintf('!! Please try again later.\n');
```

(around 28) with:

```matlab
fprintf('Error from file:%s\nFunction:%s\nOn line:%d\n', e.stack(1,1).file,e.stack(1,1).name, e.stack(1,1).line );
```

That top line says '!! Please try again later' on crash, instead of that, the bottom line will give the location and line number of the error. This change can be applied to all the programming assignments.

#### error in ex8_cofi.m (reported by Charles Davis in session ML-005)

line 199 in `ex8_cofi.m` reads

```matlab
theta = fmincg (@(t)(cofiCostFunc(t, Y, R, num_users, num_movies, num_features, lambda)), initial_parameters, options);
```

but I believe it should be

```matlab
theta = fmincg (@(t)(cofiCostFunc(t, Ynorm, R, num_users, num_movies, num_features, lambda)), initial_parameters, options);

```

...to avoid creating ratings > 5 at line 219. This doesn't affect the submissions of course, just the cosmetics of the recommendations.

Supporting analysis: Y is normalized in line 181, creating Ynorm, but then it is never used. The video lecture "Implementation Detail: Mean Normalization" at 5:34 makes it pretty clear that the normalized Y matrix should be used for calculating theta.

This errata also means that "ex8.pdf" Figure 4 is incorrect, since it shows movies with ratings greater than 5-stars.


#### Item 2: The grader uses Y with non-zero values

When using the R matrix (to ignore movies that have not been rated), do not rely on Y(i,j) to be 0 when a user has not rated a film. This expectation is true for the ex8_cofi.m script, but that is NOT true for the test case used by the submit grader for Part 3 through Part 6.

Note: This might no longer be true, the grader seems to be using Y(i,j) == 0 for when a user has not rated a film


#### Item 3: Regularization

Note: Unlike previous assignments when we performed regularization, for this exercise, we do NOT skip the 1st column of Theta or X when computing regularization. This is because we are not specifying bias units in the collaborative filtering algorithm (since the algorithm determines all of the theta values, it can set one to the '1' value if it leads to the optimum solution). Therefore, all values of Theta and X should be considered in regularization.

1.2 Estimating parameters for a Gaussian
the var function can actually return normalization with 1/m instead of 1/(m-1). Set the second argument 0 for 1/(m-1) and 1 for 1/m.


#### errors in cofiCostFunc.m

line 9 should read "% Unfold the X and Theta matrices from params"
