+ 6 powerful feature engineering techniques for time series in this article
+ feature engineering technique w/ Python


## Introduction

+ a lot of nuance to time series data to consider when working with datasets that are time-sensitive

+ feature engineering for time series: the potential to transform time series model from just a good one to a powerful forecasting model


## Quick Introduction to Time Series

+ In a time series, the data is captured at equal intervals and each successive data point in the series depends on its past values.

+ Examples:
  + predicting stock price at a certain company
  + predicting the traffic on a website

+ time series data may also have certain trends or seasonality
