## Introduction

+ choosing the right features in the right format to feed in a model boosting performances leading to the following benefits
  + enable to achieve good model performances using simpler Machine Learning models
  + using simpler ML models, increasing the transparency of model $to$ easier to understand how is making its predictions
  + reduced need to use Ensemble learning techniques
  + reduced need to perform hyperparameter optimization

+ Other common techniques to better use data:

  + [Extraction](https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-extraction-techniques-d619b56e31be)

+ Most of the basic feature engineering techniques
  + finding inconsistencies in the data
  + creating new featres by combining/dividing existing ones
